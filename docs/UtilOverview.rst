Utility Modules for SCALE Libraries
===================================

*M.L. Williams*

Historically the SCALE Code System has included a number of standalone, executable
utility modules developed mainly for performing operations on various types of
multigroup nuclear data libraries and on the standard composition library used
in SCALE.  In legacy versions of SCALE, some utility modules were directly
executed during computational sequences; but in the modern version of SCALE the
standalone executables are no longer used in computation sequences – their
functions have been incorporated into a more unified and integrated framework.
Several of the earlier utility modules were deprecated in the SCALE 6.2 release;
but others are retained and are still quite useful for nuclear data
manipulations, editing, and checking.  Most of these utilities are taken
directly from the AMPX code system. :ref:`11-1` provides a listing of the AMPX
modules distributed with SCALE, along with a brief description of each module’s
function. User input for these modules can be found in the AMPX documentation
that accompanies SCALE. Several additional utility modules included in the
SCALE code package are also described in this section. Finally, many AMPX and
SCALE utility modules use the FIDO input processing procedure, and this is
described in the FIDO chapter.
