ABSTRACT

Several modules have been developed to assist with the sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis techniques included in SCALE. TSUNAMI-IP
(**T**\ ools for **S**\ ensitivity and **U**\ ncertainty **A**\ nalysis
**M**\ ethodology **I**\ mplementation—\ **I**\ ndices and
**P**\ arameters) uses sensitivity data generated by TSUNAMI-1D, -2D, or
-3D to propagate the effect of uncertainty in nuclear data to a response
of interest, and to generate several relational parameters and indices
that predict the degree of similarity between two systems. Additionally,
the formats of files used by SCALE for sensitivity analyses are
described herein.

TSUNAMI-IP
----------

TSUNAMI-IP (**T**\ ools for **S**\ ensitivity and **U**\ ncertainty
**A**\ nalysis **M**\ ethodology **I**\ mplementation—\ **I**\ ndices
and **P**\ arameters) uses sensitivity data generated by TSUNAMI-1D,
-2D, or -3D and cross-section-covariance data described in the COVLIB
chapterH to generate several relational parameters and indices that can
be used to determine the degree of similarity between two systems.
TSUNAMI-IP combines many techniques developed over several years into a
comprehensive package with simplified input. Most of the techniques
developed for TSUNAMI-IP are documented in Ref. D [1]_D, other
techniques are documented in Refs. D [2]_D, D [3]_D and D [4]_D, and
others are originally presented in this document.

Depending on the user selected options, voluminous output can be
generated by TSUNAMI-IP. To assist with review of these data, TSUNAMI-IP
was the first SCALE module to offer HTML formatted output. This document
first describes the indices and parameters that are computed, presents a
description of the user input, then finally a sample problem is
presented where the standard text output and the HTML formatted output
are described.

TSUNAMI-IP was introduced in SCALE 5.0 and improved in SCALE 5.1. In
SCALE 6.0, TSUNAMI-IP now includes an individual *c*\ :sub:`k` to better
quantify uncertainty-based similarity on a nuclide-reaction specific
level. The *E*\ :sub:`sum`\ parameter has since been replaced with a
sensitivity-only parameter, simply called *E*, which is based on more
rigorous mathematical definition. The input format has been expanded
with additional keywords to identify sensitivity data and a *RESPONSE*
data block that allows users to define applications and experiments
within the same input block. Uncertainty and penalty edits can also be
presented with relative or absolute values, where previously only
relative values were available. The input of user-defined covariance
data now allows much greater flexibility, and the covariance data used
in the problem can now be exported to a COVERX formatted data file for
subsequent plotting in Javapeño.

Global integral indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Three global integral indices that assess the similarity of a particular
application and a single experiment on a system-wide basis for all
nuclides and reactions are defined in this section. The integral indices
are *c*\ :sub:`k,`\  *E*\ , and *G*. Each of these indices is defined in
subsequent subsections, and TSUNAMI-IP input options used to generate
these indices and produce specific output edits are explained. Each
integral index is normalized such that a value of 1.0 indicates complete
similarity between the application and the experiment and a value of 0.0
indicates no similarity.

.. _6-5-1-1-1:

Integral index *ck*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A rigorous approach to assessing the similarity of two systems for
purposes of criticality code validation is the use of uncertainty
analysis, which propagates the tabulated cross-section-uncertainty
information to the calculated *k\ eff* value of a given system via the
energy-dependent sensitivity coefficients.X1X Mathematically, the system
uncertainty is computed with a quadratic product of the group-wise
sensitivity profile vectors by nuclide and reaction type with the
group-wise cross-section uncertainty matrices by nuclide and reaction
type. The result of this procedure is not only an estimate of the
uncertainty in the system *k\ eff* due to cross sections, but also an
estimate of the correlated uncertainty between systems. These correlated
uncertainties can be represented by correlation coefficients, which
represent the degree of correlation in the uncertainties between the two
systems. This correlation coefficient index, denoted as |ck|, not only
has the desirability of a single quantity relating the two systems, but
also measures the similarity of the systems in terms of related
uncertainty. These correlation coefficients are particularly useful when
used in traditional trending analyses for criticality safety validation
in that the correlation coefficient relates the degree in which the
uncertainties in the critical benchmarks are coupled with the
uncertainties in the application of interest. This coupling with the
common uncertainties in the various systems is expected to closely mimic
the coupling in predicted biases between the various systems, since they
should both be related to the cross-section uncertainties.

The cross-section-covariance data are read from a COVERX formatted data
file identified by *coverx=* in the *PARAMETER* input. The
cross-section-covariance data file 44GROUPCOV distributed with SCALE is
discussed in the COVLIB chapterH, and the format of the COVERX data file
is presented in Appendix A, *COVERX Format*. A prerequisite in the
uncertainty analysis approach is that cross-section-uncertainty data for
all nuclides and reactions of interest have been evaluated and processed
for use by these procedures. However, evaluated
cross-section-uncertainty data are not available for all
nuclide-reaction pairs. Nuclide-reaction pairs without data are omitted
from this analysis, but it is assumed that either the cross-section data
values from these pairs are well known (i.e., small uncertainties), or
that the sensitivity of the system *k\ eff* to these nuclide-reaction
pairs is small. Where these assumptions hold, the nuclide-reaction pairs
without cross-section-uncertainty data present a negligible contribution
to the uncertainty-based analysis. For situations where this negligible
contribution assumption is judged to be invalid, the use of uncertainty
analysis is not appropriate. However, the *COVARIANCE* data block can be
used to input uncertainty values for the cross-section data for
particular nuclide-reaction pairs to assess the impact of additional
covariance data. To utilize the covariance data generated by user input
in the *COVARIANCE* data block, the keyword *use_icov* must be entered
in the *PARAMETER* data block. Additionally, default uncertainty values
can be assigned for all unknown covariance data. This default
uncertainty data is input in the *PARAMETER* data block and the keyword
*use_dcov* must be entered to activate its use. Warning messages are
printed to identify substituted covariance matrices.

When *use_dcov* and/or *use_icov* and *cov_fix* are specified in the
*PARAMETER* data block, and a reaction has zero or large (standard
deviation > 1000%) values on the diagonal of the covariance matrix,
these values are replaced with the square of the user input or default
standard deviation values, and the corresponding off-diagonal terms are
substituted according to the user input or default correlation values.
Warning messages are printed to identify which values were replaced and
which standard deviation value was used in the replacement.

The mathematical development of the integral index *c*\ :sub:`k` is presented
here based on the development given in Ref. X1X. The nuclear data
parameters (i.e., group wise nuclide-reaction specific cross sections)
are represented by the vector **α** ≡ (*α*\ :sub:`m`), *m* = 1, 2, ..., *M*,
where *M* is the number of nuclide-reaction pairs × the number of energy
groups. The corresponding symmetric *M × M* matrix containing the
relative variances (diagonal elements) and covariances (off-diagonal
elements) in the nuclear data are

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-1

  {{\mathbf{C}}_{\alpha \alpha }}\equiv \left[ \frac{\text{COV}({{\alpha }_{m}},{{\alpha }_{p}})}{{{\alpha }_{m}}{{\alpha }_{p}}} \right] , m = 1, 2, …, M; p = 1, 2, …, M ,

where

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-2

  \text{COV}({{\alpha }_{m}},{{\alpha }_{p}})=\left\langle \delta {{\alpha }_{m}}\delta {{\alpha }_{p}} \right\rangle

where *δα*\ :sub:`m` and *δα*\ :sub:`p` represent the difference between the values
and expectation values of the nuclear data parameters and represents
integration over the ranges of *α*\ :sub:`m` and *α*\ :sub:`p` weighted with a
probability density function. A rigorous definition of the
cross-section-covariance data are given in Ref. D [5]_D.

The matrix containing sensitivities of the calculated *k\ eff* to the
**α** parameters is given as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-3

  {{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{k}}}\equiv \left[ \frac{{{\alpha }_{m}}}{{{k}_{i}}}\frac{\partial {{k}_{i}}}{\partial {{\alpha }_{m}}} \right] , i = 1, 2, …, I; m = 1, 2, …, M,

where *I* is the number of critical systems being considered. In
TSUNAMI-IP, the elements of **S\ k**\ are the sensitivity coefficients
read from the sensitivity data files identified in the *APPLICATIONS*
and *EXPERIMENTS* data blocks. The uncertainty matrix for the system
*k\ eff* values, **C**\ :math:`_{\bf{\text{kk}}}`, is given as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-4

  {{\mathbf{C}}_{\mathbf{kk}}}={{\mathbf{S}}_{\mathbf{k}}}{{\mathbf{C}}_{\alpha \alpha }}\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger }

where *†* indicates a transpose.

Sk is an I x M matrix; :math:`_{\bf{\alpha \alpha}}` is an M × M matrix; and the resulting :math:`_{\bf{\text{kk}}}` matrix is
of dimension I × I.  The :math:`_{\bf{\text{kk}}}` matrix consists of relative variance values,
:math:`\sigma _{i}^{2}`, for each of the systems under consideration (the diagonal
elements), as well as the relative covariance between systems,
:math:`\sigma_{ij}^{2}` (the off-diagonal elements).  These off-diagonal elements represent
the shared or common variance between two systems.  The off diagonal elements
are typically divided by the square root of the corresponding diagonal elements
(i.e., the respective standard deviations) to generate a correlation coefficient
matrix.  Thus, the correlation coefficient is defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-5

  {{c}_{k}}=\frac{\sigma _{ij}^{2}}{\left( {{\sigma }_{i}}{{\sigma }_{j}} \right)}

such that the single *c*\ :sub:`k` value represents the correlation coefficient
between uncertainties in system \ *i* and system \ *j*.

These correlations are primarily due to the fact that the uncertainties
in the calculated *k\ eff *\ values for two different systems are
related, since they contain the same materials. Cross-section
uncertainties propagate to all systems containing these materials.
Systems with the same materials and similar spectra would be correlated,
while systems with different materials or spectra would not be
correlated. The interpretation of the correlation coefficient is the
following: a value of 0.0 represents no correlation between the systems,
a value of 1.0 represents full correlation between the systems, and a
value of −1.0 represents a full anti-correlation.

To request the computation of |ck| for each application identified in
the *APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to each experiment
in the *EXPERIMENTS* portion of the input, simply enter the input *c* in
the *PARAMETER* section of the input. Additionally, the *values* table
must be requested to output the full listing of *c*\ :sub:`k` values. The
*csummary* edit prints a listing of all experiments that have a
*c*\ :sub:`k` value exceeding the criteria value set by *cvalue*\ =.

.. _6-5-1-1-2:

Integral index *c*\ :math:`_r`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The integral index |ck| is intended for investigative analysis and is
defined as |ck| with user-defined reactions removed from
consideration. The *EXCLUSIONS* data block is used to identify which
reactions will be excluded from consideration in the calculation of
|ck|. If the user identifies no reactions, then *c*\ :math:`_r` will compute
the same value as *c*\ :math:`_k`. Using *c*\ :math:`_r` is equivalent to removing all
sensitivities for a given reaction or series of reactions for all
nuclides from the sensitivity data file for all applications and all
experiments considered in the analysis.

To request the computation of *c*\ :math:`_r` for each application identified in
the *APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to each experiment
in the *EXPERIMENTS* portion of the input, simply enter the input *cr*
in the *PARAMETER* section of the input. Additionally, the *values*
table must be requested to output the full listing of *c*\ :math:`_r` values. The
*crsummary* edit prints a listing of all experiments that have a
*c*\ :math:`_r` value exceeding the criteria value set by *crvalue*\ =.

.. _6-5-1-1-3:

Integral index *E*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *E* index is a replacement for the previous *E*\ :sub:`sum` index, which
was present in TSUNAMI-IP for SCALE 5.0 and 5.1.1. If the group-wise
sensitivity data for all nuclides and reactions for each system is
thought of as a vector, then the integral index *E* is the cosine of the
angle between the two sensitivity vectors for the analyzed systems. If
the two sensitivity vectors are parallel, i.e., proportional, the
systems are similar. *E* does not require cross-section covariance data
and is normalized such that an *E* value of 0.0 indicates the systems
are totally dissimilar, and an *E* value of 1.0 indicates the two
systems are the same. Mathematically, an *E* value as low as −1.0 could
be generated, but this would be the result of a rare combination of
system sensitivity coefficients such that the sensitivity of the
respective system responses would have to be exactly proportional in
magnitude and opposite in sign, which seems not to be physically
feasible. The *E* parameter is considered global in nature because its
single quantity assesses similarity between two systems based on the
magnitude and shape of all sensitivity profiles. The vector **S\ i** is
defined as the sensitivity *vector* (not matrix) for a particular
application or experiment “i.” The magnitude of the sensitivity vector
corresponds to the L2 norm: :math:`\left|\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{i}}\right|=\sqrt{\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\mathbf{T}} \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{i}}}`.
The *E* value for a given application *a*
with experiment *e* is then

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-6

  E \equiv \frac{\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{a}}^{\mathbf{T}} \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{e}}}{\left|\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{a}}\right|\left|\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{e}}\right|}

The similarity of systems in terms of their sensitivities to only the
fission, capture or scatter reactions can also be evaluated as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-7

  E_{x} \equiv \frac{\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{a}}^{\mathbf{T}} \mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}}}{\left|\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{a}}\right|\left|\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}}\right|} ,


where the vectors :math:`S_{x,a}^{{}}` and :math:`S_{x,e}^{{}}` represent the
sensitivity of application and experiment to fission, capture, or scatter
reaction *x*.

To request the computation of *E* for each application identified in the
*APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to each experiment in
the *EXPERIMENTS* portion of the input, simply enter the input *e* in
the *PARAMETER* section of the input. Additionally, the *values* table
must be requested to output the full listing of *E* values. The reaction
components of *E* (i.e., *E*\ :sub:`f`, *E*\ :sub:`c` and *E*\ :sub:`s`) are included in the
*values* table if *prtparts* is entered in the input. The
reaction-specific components of *E* are each normalized between -1 and
1, the same as *E* itself. The *esummary* edit prints a listing of all
experiments that have an *E* value exceeding the criteria value set by
*evalue*\ =.

.. _6-5-1-1-4:

Integral index *G*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *G* index assesses the similarity of two systems based on normalized
differences in the energy-dependent sensitivity data for fission,
capture, and scatter. [2] The similarity measure used for *G*
is based on the concept of coverage of the application by an experiment.
A physical interpretation of the *G* index is the ratio of the sum of
the sensitivity coefficients of the application that are covered by the
experiment to the sum of the sensitivity coefficients for the
application. The *G* index, sometimes referred to as “big G” is defined
as:

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-8

  G=1-\frac{\sum\limits_{n}{\sum\limits_{x}{\sum\limits_{j}{\left( S_{x,j}^{a,n}-S_{x,j}^{{e}',n} \right)}}}}{\sum\limits_{n}{\sum\limits_{x}{\sum\limits_{j}{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}}}}

where,

  .. math::

    S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}=\left\{ \begin{array}{*{35}{l}}
       S_{x,j}^{e,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|\ge \left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
       S_{x,j}^{a,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|<\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
       \text{0,} & \text{otherwise}  \\
    \end{array} \right.

the *n* summation is performed over all nuclides present in the
application system,

the *x* summation is performed over fission, capture and scatter
reactions (*f*, *c*, and *s*) as appropriate for each nuclide, and

the *j* summation is performed over all energy groups.

The use of 1 minus the normalized difference makes the range of this
index consistent with *c*\ :sub:`k` and *E*\ :sub:`sum`. Hence, a *G* of 1 indicates
complete similarity and a *G* value of 0 indicates no similarity.

The definition of :math:`S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}` restricts the coverage of the application by the
experiment to the portion of the experiment’s sensitivity coefficient
that does not exceed that of the application in magnitude. Additionally,
the application’s sensitivity coefficient and that of the experiment
must have the same sign. The coverage for :sup:`1`\ H scatter for an
example application and experiment is illustrated in :numref:`fig6-5-1`
where the energy-dependent sensitivity profiles for the application, the
experiment and the coverage of the application by the experiment are
shown in green, red and blue, respectively. Because the sensitivity
coefficients for the application and the experiment have opposite signs
at energies just above 1 × 10\ :sup:`−2` eV, the application provides no
coverage for the experiment for these groups. Also, for several groups,
the sensitivity of the application exceeds that of the experiment and
only partial coverage is provided. Partial coverage is illustrated where
the application data (green) exceeds the coverage (blue). In other
groups, the sensitivity of the experiment exceeds that of the
application. In these groups, full coverage is provided, but the
coverage is not allowed to exceed the sensitivity of the application.
This is illustrated in groups where the experiment data (red) exceeds
the coverage data (blue). With the limitation of the coverage as the
value of the applications sensitivity coefficient, the experiment cannot
provide “extra credit” in coverage for sensitivity coefficients that
exceed those of the application.

  Illustration of coverage for :sup:`1`\ H scatter.

The coverage for :sup:`10`\ B capture for an example application and
experiment is illustrated in :numref:`fig6-5-2`. In this figure, the
sensitivity coefficients are all negative. The magnitudes of the
sensitivity coefficients for the experiment far exceed those of the
application at thermal energies. However, coverage is only provided to
the magnitudes of the sensitivity coefficients of the application.

  Illustration of coverage for :sup:`10`\ B capture.

Assessment of similarity over a particular reaction type (fission,
capture or scatter) can be made with a partial *G* value. A *G*\ :sub:`x` value
can be computed by eliminating the sum over reactions, *x* in :eq:`eq6-5-10`, as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-9

  {{G}_{x}}=1-\frac{\sum\limits_{n}{\sum\limits_{j}{\left( S_{x,j}^{a,n}-S_{x,j}^{{e}',n} \right)}}}{\sum\limits_{n}{\sum\limits_{j}{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}}}

where

  *x* is *f*, *c*, or *s*.

To request the computation of *G* for each application identified in the
*APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to each experiment in
the *EXPERIMENTS* portion of the input, simply enter the input *g* in
the *PARAMETER* section of the input. Additionally, the *values* table
must be requested to output the full listing of *G *\ values. The
reaction components of *G* (i.e., *G*\ :sub:`f`, *G*\ :sub:`c` and *G*\ :sub:`s`) are
included in the *values* table if *prtparts* is entered in the input.
The *G*\ :sub:`x` indices are normalized such they also have a range of 0 to 1,
where a *G*\ :sub:`x` of 1 indicates complete similarity of sensitivity
coefficients for that particular reaction type *x* between the
application and experiment. The *gsummary* edit prints a listing of all
experiments that have a *G* value exceeding the criteria value set by
*gvalue*\ =.

Nuclide-reaction specific integral indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The global integral indices described in :ref:`6-5-1-1` assess system
similarity for all nuclides and reactions in the application system. It
is also possible and sometimes desirable to produce values analogous to
*G*, *E*, and *c*\ :sub:`k` for each nuclide-reaction pair, such that
similarity can be assessed on a nuclide-reaction-specific level.


.. _6-5-1-2-1:

Nuclide-reaction specific integral index *g*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nuclide-reaction specific integral index based on the same coverage
criteria as G is denoted g, and sometimes referred to as “little g.” [2]
It is defined in terms of the normalized differences of the group wise
sensitivity coefficients for a particular nuclide, n, and reaction, x,
summed over all energy groups, j, as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-10

  g_{x}^{n}=1-\frac{\sum\limits_{j}{\left( S_{x,j}^{a,n}-S_{x,j}^{{e}',n} \right)}}{\sum\limits_{j}{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}}

where,

  .. math::

    S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}=\left\{ \begin{array}{*{35}{l}}
       S_{x,j}^{e,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|\ge \left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
       S_{x,j}^{a,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|<\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
       \text{0,} & \text{otherwise}  \\
    \end{array} \right.

  and the *j* summation is performed over all energy groups.

The criteria for g are the same as those explained in :ref:`6-5-1-1-3`. The only
difference in g and G is that the summations over nuclide and reaction
have been removed. As with other integral indices, the g index is
normalized such that a g value of 1 indicates complete coverage of the
application by the experiment for the particular nuclide-reaction pair.
A g value of 0 indicates no coverage of the application by the
experiment for the particular nuclide-reaction pair.

To request the computation of g (“little g”) for each application
identified in the APPLICATIONS section of the input in relation to each
experiment in the EXPERIMENTS portion of the input for fission, capture
and scatter reactions for each nuclide in the application, simply enter
the input *lg* in the PARAMETER section of the input. The *lg* data
appears in the nuclide-reaction specific edit for each application and
only includes nuclide-reaction pairs with energy integrated sensitivity
coefficients with at least the magnitude of *sencut*. Additionally,
g values are printed for each nuclide-reaction pair specified in the
REACTIONS data block. The *lgall* edit prints all the g values for
fission, capture and scatter for all nuclides in the application in
relation to all experiments regardless of the magnitude of the
energy-integrated sensitivity value. The *lgsum* edit prints a listing
of all g values exceeding the criteria value set by *lgvalue=* for
fission, capture and scatter reactions for each nuclide. The *lggroups*
edit prints a long table listing the numbers of experiments that are at
least as sensitive as the application for each group for each
nuclide-reaction pair requested in the REACTIONS data block.


.. _6-5-1-2-2:

Extended *c*\ :math:`_k`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extended |ck| edit lists the contribution of each
nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction energy covariance matrix to the
global integral index |ck|. A single entry in this edit is computed by
utilizing a subset of the **C**\ :sub:`αα`  matrix and the **S**\ :sub:`k`
sensitivity vectors for the application and the experiment. Thus, the
extended *c*\ :sub:`k` for a nuclide-reaction pair in the application in
relation to a nuclide-reaction pair in the experiment is defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-11

  c_{k,{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}},{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}^{contribution}=\frac{\sigma _{{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}},{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}^{2}}{\left( {{\sigma }_{a}}{{\sigma }_{e}} \right)}

where,

  (n-j)\ :sub:`a` represents the nuclide n and reaction j of the application a,
  (m-k)\ :sub:`e` represents the nuclide m and reaction k of the experiment e,
  :math:`\sigma _{{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}},{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}^{2}`	represents the covariance between application a and experiment e due to this nuclide-reaction pairs,
  :math:`\sigma_a`			is the standard deviation in keff for the application due to all cross-section covariance data, and
  :math:`\sigma_e`			is the standard deviation in keff for the experiment due to all cross-section covariance data.


The global integral index |ck| can be reconstructed from the extended
*c*\ :math:`_k` components by summing the extended *c*\ :math:`_k` over all
nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction values. Thus, the extended *c*\ :math:`_k`
allows the user to determine the contribution of
nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances to |ck|. All
covariance data, default covariance data and user-input covariance data
used in the calculation of *c*\ :math:`_k`, as outlined in :ref:`6-5-1-1`, are also
applied to the extended *c*\ :math:`_k` data.
Nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances using default and
user-input values are identified with one and two asterisks,
respectively, in the text output, and are identified with unique colors
in the HTML output. Nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances
using default and user-input values for *cov­_fix­* adjustments are
identified with three and four asterisks, respectively, in the text
output, and are identified with unique colors in the HTML output.
Warning messages are printed to identify which zero values were replaced
and which standard deviation value was used in the substitution.

The extended *c*\ :math:`_k` edit also includes an individual |ck| to examine
the similarity of an application and experiment based only on a single
nuclide-reaction pair. The individual *c*\ :math:`_k` is similar to the
*c*\ :math:`_k`\ contribution from :eq:`eq6-5-11`, except that it is normalized between -1
and 1 for each nuclide-reaction pair as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-12

  c_{k,{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}},{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}^{individual}=\frac{\sigma _{{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}},{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}^{2}}{\left( {{\sigma }_{{{\left( n-j \right)}_{a}}}}{{\sigma }_{{{\left( m-k \right)}_{e}}}} \right)}

Note that individual *c*\ :math:`_k` values computed for a nuclide-reaction pair
in an application to the same nuclide-reaction pair in the experiment.
Although cross-reaction and cross-nuclide covariance data are available,
the cross-relationship has no physical interpretation for assessing for
assessing the similarity of systems for a specific nuclide-reaction
pair.

To request the computation of extended |ck| for each application
identified in the APPLICATIONS section of the input in relation to each
experiment in the EXPERIMENTS portion of the input, simply enter the
input *c_long* in the PARAMETER section of the input.

.. _6-5-1-2-3:

Extended *c*\ :math:`_r`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the extended *c*\ :math:`_k` edit, the extended *c*\ :math:`_r` edit lists
the contribution of each nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction energy
covariance matrix to the global integral index |ck|. An individual
*c*\ :math:`_r` evaluating the similarity of each application to each experiment
in terms of only one nuclide-reaction pair, normalized from -1 to 1, is
also available. The computation of the extended *c*\ :math:`_r` is the same as
that of extended *c*\ :math:`_k`, but with user-defined reactions removed from
consideration. The *EXCLUSIONS* data block is used to identify which
reactions will be excluded from consideration in the calculation of
*c*\ :math:`_r` and its components as presented in extended *c*\ :math:`_r`. If the user
identifies no reactions, then *c*\ :math:`_r` and extended *c*\ :math:`_r` will be
computed the same as *c*\ :math:`_k` and extended *c*\ :math:`_k`. The *c*\ :math:`_r` parameter
and extended *c*\ :math:`_r` edit are equivalent to removing all sensitivities
for a given reaction or series of reactions from the sensitivity data
file for all applications and all experiments considered in the
analysis.

As with extended *c*\ :math:`_k`, nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction
covariances using default and user-input values are identified with one
and two asterisks, respectively, in the text output, and are identified
with unique colors in the HTML output.
Nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances using default and
user-input values for *cov­_fix­* adjustments are identified with three
and four asterisks, respectively, in the text output, and are identified
with unique colors in the HTML output. Warning messages are printed to
identify which values were replaced and which standard deviation value
was used in the substitution.

To request the computation of extended *c*\ :math:`_r` for each application
identified in the *APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to
each experiment in the *EXPERIMENTS* portion of the input, simply enter
the input *cr_long* in the *PARAMETER* section of the input.

.. _6-5-1-3:

Penalty assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A method is available to assess an additional margin to subcriticality,
or penalty, where sufficient experiments are not available to provide
complete coverage for a particular application. [3] This penalty is
intended as an additional uncertainty component that can be added to the
calculated value of *k\ eff* to provide an added measure of safety for
application systems where validation coverage is lacking. The penalty
calculation is based on the criteria for coverage explained in :ref:`6-5-1-1-3`.
The criteria for coverage in this implementation of the penalty
assessment is that if a single experiment that passes qualification
tests for the particular application exhibits a sensitivity coefficient
for a particular energy group for a particular nuclide-reaction pair
that is at least as great in magnitude and has the same sign as the
corresponding sensitivity coefficient for the application, then adequate
coverage exists for the code validation of the application. For
group-wise nuclide-reaction specific sensitivity coefficients for the
application that are not fully covered by the experiments, the uncovered
portion of the sensitivity coefficient is used to compute an uncertainty
in *k\ eff* though the cross-section-covariance data.

Any experiment used in the penalty assessment calculation must pass a
qualification test to determine global similarity of the experiment,
based on a global integral index (*c*\ :math:`_k`, *E*, or *G*), and may also
have to pass a nuclide-reaction specific qualification test based on the
*g* integral index. Thus, only experiments that exhibit a certain degree
of similarity to the application can be considered in this calculation,
unless the tests are deactivated at the user’s discretion. Additionally,
a number of similar experiments may be required before any penalty
assessment is produced.

To compute the penalty, a vector of the minimum differences in the
sensitivity coefficients, :math:`\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbf{a}}`, for the application with respect to
all experiments can be obtained as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-13

  {{\mathbf{Z}}_{\mathbf{a}}}\equiv \left[ Z_{x,j}^{a,n} \right] n=1,…,N, x=1,…,X, j=1,..,J


where,

:math:`Z_{x,j}^{a,n}=S_{x,j}^{a,n}-C_{x,j}^{a,n}`,

:math:`C_{x,j}^{a,n}` is a composite of the best available sensitivity data from all experiments and is defined as

:math:`C_{x,j}^{a,n} = S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}` for the experiment that satisfies :math:`\text{min}\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n}-S_{x,j}^{{e}',n} \right|`, e\ :math:`^{\prime}` =1,…,E,

.. math::

  S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}=\left\{ \begin{array}{*{35}{l}}
   S_{x,j}^{e,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|\ge \left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
   S_{x,j}^{a,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|<\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
   \text{0,} & \text{otherwise}  \\
  \end{array} \right.

*a* represents a particular application,

*e* represents a particular experiment,

*n* represents a particular nuclide,

*x* represents a particular reaction,

*j* represents a particular energy group,

*N* = number of nuclides in the application system,

*X* = number of reactions for each nuclide,

*J* = number of energy groups, and

*E* = number of experiments meeting the qualification tests.


Once **Z**\ :math:`\bf{a}` is computed, the portion of the sensitivity of the
application that is not covered by the experiments can be used to
propagate the uncertainty in the cross-section data to a relative
uncertainty in *k\ eff* as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-14

  \Delta {{k}_{eff}}/{{k}_{eff}}=\sqrt{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbf{a}}^{{}}\mathbf{C}_{\alpha \alpha }^{{}}\mathbf{Z}{{_{\mathbf{a}}^{{}}}^{\dagger }}}

where *†* indicates a transpose and **C**\ :math:`_{\mathbf{\alpha \alpha}}` is the matrix of the
cross-section-covariance data defined in :eq:`eq6-5-1` . In the above equation,
the elements of **Z**\ :math:`_{\mathbf{a}}` are each expressed in terms of :math:`(\Delta {{k}_{eff}}/{{k}_{eff}})/(\Delta \Sigma /\Sigma )`,
and the
elements of :math:`{{C}_{\mathbf{\alpha \alpha}}}` are expressed in terms of relative variances or covariances
as :math:`{{(\Delta \Sigma /\Sigma )}^{2}}`, so that the final penalty is expressed as a relative uncertainty in
*k\ eff* , :math:`\Delta {{k}_{eff}}/{{k}_{eff}}`. This relative uncertainty in *k\ eff*\ is written to the
output file in the penalty calculations.


To request the penalty computation for each application identified in
the *APPLICATIONS* section of the input in relation to all experiments
in the *EXPERIMENTS* section of the input, simply enter the input
*penalty* in the *PARAMETER* section of the input. Additionally, a list
of the contribution each nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariance
matrix to the total penalty can be viewed by entering *penlong* in the
*PARAMETER* input. This creates an edit similar to the Uncertainty
Information edit of the SAMS module. Each value shown in this output
edit represents the relative penalty in percent (%∆\ *k*/*k*) due to the
specified nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariance matrix. The
values are sorted in order of descending magnitude. The cumulative
penalty can be constructed by squaring the individual values, then
adding those that had positive signs and subtracting those that had
negative signs, then taking the square root. Negative values in the
table result from covariance matrices that have anticorrelated values.

The qualification test for including or excluding experiments from the
development of the penalty for a particular application is set by
several input parameters. The purpose of the qualification test is to
ensure that some relevant data are used in the calculation. Otherwise,
in the limit that no relevant data are used in the penalty calculation,
the **Z**\ :sub:`a` minimum difference sensitivity vector becomes **S**\ :sub:`a`,
the sensitivity vector for the application. In this case, the maximum
penalty assessed is simply the uncertainty in the application’s
criticality calculation due to cross-section-covariance data.

A global qualification test, to test the similarity of a particular
experiment to the given application based on a global integral index, is
configured with the keywords: *penusec*, *penusee* and *penuseg*. These
keywords are used to produce a penalty calculation that only includes
experiments with *c*\ :math:`_k`, *E,* or *G* values at least as great as
*cvalue*, *evalue* or *gvalue*, respectively. The default value is
*penusec*. If more than one of the keywords *penusec*, *penusee* or
*penuseg* are included in the input, only the last one entered will be
used. The penalty is only computed for a given application if the number
of experiments passing the global integral index qualification test is
at least as great as *penminx* (default = 10). If no global test is
desired, enter *penminx*\ =0.

The *pencut=* keyword allows the user to set a discriminator for
excluding nuclide-reaction pairs from the application with small
sensitivity coefficients from the penalty calculation. If the sum of the
absolute values of the group-wise sensitivity coefficients is below
*pencut*, the nuclide reaction pair is excluded from the penalty
calculation. The default value is 0.0, which includes all
nuclide-reaction pairs in the penalty calculation. Additionally,
*penlgv=* sets a discriminator that only includes experiments with a
*g* value relative to the application for a given nuclide-reaction pair
that meets or exceeds *penlgv*. Thus, using *penlgv* may allow some
nuclide-reaction pairs from a given experiment to be included in the
penalty calculation, but exclude others from the same experiment that do
not meet the criteria. The default value is 0.0, which means include all
nuclide-reaction pairs that pass the other qualification tests.

The keyword *penwarn* activates a penalty warning edit that details
which experiments were excluded from the penalty calculation based on
failing the global qualification test, and which nuclide-reaction pairs
were excluded from the penalty calculation based on failing the
nuclide-reaction specific tests.

The composite of the best available sensitivity data from all
experiments that meet the requested criteria, as used in the calculation
of the penalty, can be viewed with the composite sensitivity data for
nuclides and reactions requested in the *REACTIONS* input data block
with the input keyword *prtcomp* described in :ref:`6-5-1-4-3`.

The **C**\ :math:`_{\mathbf{\alpha \alpha}}` matrix in :eq:`eq6-5-14`  is the cross-section covariance data read
in the COVERX formatted data file identified by *coverx=*. As in the
calculation of *c*\ :sub:`k`, nuclide-reaction pairs without available
covariance data are omitted from this analysis, but it is assumed that
either the cross-section data values from these pairs are well known
(i.e., small uncertainties), or that the sensitivity of the system
*k\ eff* to these nuclide-reaction pairs is small. Where these
assumptions hold, the nuclide-reaction pairs without
cross-section-uncertainty data present a negligible contribution to the
penalty calculation. For situations where this negligible contribution
assumption is judged not to be valid, the use of uncertainty analysis
for the computation of a penalty is not appropriate. However, the
*COVARIANCE* data block can be used to input uncertainty values for the
cross-section data for particular nuclide-reaction pairs to assess the
impact of additional covariance data. To utilize the covariance data
generated by user input in the *COVARIANCE* data block, the keyword
*use_icov* must be entered in the *PARAMETER* data block. Additionally,
default uncertainty values can be assigned for all unknown covariance
data. The default uncertainty data input in the *PARAMETER* data block
and the keyword *use_dcov* must be entered to activate its use. In the
extended penalty edit, nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances
using default and user-input values are identified with one and two
asterisks, respectively, in the text output, and are identified with
unique colors in the HTML output. Warning messages are also printed to
identify substituted covariance matrices.

When *use_dcov* and/or *use_icov* and *cov_fix* are specified in the
*PARAMETER* data block, and a reaction has zero or large (standard
deviation > 1000%) values on the diagonal of the covariance matrix,
these values are replaced with the square of the user input or default
standard deviation values, and the corresponding off-diagonal terms are
substituted according to the user input or default correlation values.
In the extended penalty edit, nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction
covariances using default and user-input values for *cov­_fix­*
adjustments are identified with three and four asterisks, respectively,
in the text output, and are identified with unique colors in the HTML
output. Warning messages are printed to identify which values were
replaced and which standard deviation value was used in the
substitution.

.. _6-5-1-4:

Other parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TSUNAMI-IP can produce a number of other parameters that are useful for analysis
of systems.  These are briefly explained in this section.

.. _6-5-1-4-1:

Uncertainty information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The keyword *uncert* activates the calculation of the uncertainty in
*k\ eff* due to the cross-section-covariance data read from the COVERX
formatted data file identified by *coverx=*. The uncertainty is computed
for each application and each experiment and is printed in the *values*
table as a standard deviation value with its statistical uncertainty, if
appropriate. The uncertainty value printed is a relative uncertainty in
percent (i.e., :math:`\Delta {{k}_{eff}}/{{k}_{eff}}` × 100%).

Nuclide-reaction pairs without available data are omitted from this
analysis, but it is assumed that either the cross-section data values
from these pairs are well known (i.e., small uncertainties), or that the
sensitivity of the system *k\ eff* to these nuclide-reaction pairs is
small. Where these assumptions hold, the nuclide-reaction pairs without
cross-section-uncertainty data present a negligible contribution to the
uncertainty-based analysis. For situations where this negligible
contribution assumption is judged not to be valid, the use of
uncertainty analysis is not appropriate. However, the *COVARIANCE* data
block can be used to input uncertainty values for the cross-section data
for particular nuclide-reaction pairs to assess the impact of additional
covariance data. To utilize the covariance data generated by user input
in the *COVARIANCE* data block, the keyword *use_icov* must be entered
in the *PARAMETER* data block. Additionally, default uncertainty data
can be assigned for all unknown covariance data. This default data is
input in the *PARAMETER* data block and the keyword *use_dcov* must be
entered to activate its use.

To request a listing of the contributions
nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariance matrix to the
uncertainty in the *k\ eff* value for each application identified in the
*APPLICATIONS* section of the input enter the input keyword
*uncert_long* in the *PARAMETER* section of the input. This creates an
edit similar to the Uncertainty Information edit of the SAMS module.
Each value shown in this output edit represents the relative uncertainty
in percent (%∆\ *k*/*k*) due to the specified
nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariance matrix. The values are
sorted in order of descending magnitude. The cumulative uncertainty can
be constructed by squaring the individual values, then adding those that
had positive signs and subtracting those that had negative signs, then
taking the square root. Negative values in the table result from
covariance matrices that have anticorrelated values.

In the extended uncertainty edit, nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction
covariances using default and user-input values are identified with one
and two asterisks, respectively, in the text output, and are identified
with unique colors in the HTML output.
Nuclide-reaction-to-nuclide-reaction covariances using default and
user-input values for *cov­_fix­* adjustments are identified with three
and four asterisks, respectively, in the text output, and are identified
with unique colors in the HTML output. Warning messages are printed to
identify which values were replaced and which standard deviation value
was used in the substitution.

.. _6-5-1-4-2:

Completeness parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A parameter has been developed to assess the completeness of a set of
experiments for the code validation of a given application. [4] The set
of experiments is “complete” in the sense that it completely tests all
the important cross-section elements in the particular application of
interest. The availability of sensitivity coefficients provides a key
element in the definition of this completeness parameter.

The completeness parameter, *R*, is defined as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-15

  R={{{S}_{a}}}/{{{S}_{t}}}\;

where

.. math::

  \begin{aligned}
  \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}} &=\sum_{\mathrm{n}} \sum_{\mathrm{x}} \sum_{\mathrm{j}}\left|\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{n}}\right| \\
  S_{a} &=\sum_{n} \sum_{x} \sum_{j}\left|d S_{x, j}^{a, n}\right|
  \end{aligned}

and

.. math::

  d=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & \text{ }1,\text{ if }N_{x,j}^{n}\ge nix\lim  \\
  & \text{ }0,\text{ if }N_{x,j}^{n}<nix\lim  \\
  \end{align} \right. ,

..

  :math:`N_{x,j}^{n}`	= 	number of systems for which :math:`S_{x,j}^{e,n}` > | senfac × :math:`S_{x,j}^{a,n}`|

  *e* = experiment,

  *a* = application,

  :math:`S_{x,j}^{e,n}` = the sensitivity of *k\ eff* of an experiment to the cross sections
  of the constituent material nuclide *n*, reaction *x*, and energy
  group *j*,

  :math:`S_{x,j}^{a,n}` = the sensitivity of *k\ eff* of the application to the cross
  sections of the constituent material nuclide *n*, reaction *x*, and
  energy group *j*,

  *nixlim* = an integer, and

  *senfac* = a real number such that 0.0 ≤ *senfac* ≤ 1.0.


The completeness parameter is designed to give the effective fraction of
the total sensitivity for each application system that is “covered” by
the benchmark set. This coverage is defined by comparing the magnitude
of each group-wise sensitivity coefficient for the application with
respect to each of the corresponding sensitivities of the benchmark
systems. The completeness parameter is computed for each application for
each experiment if the keyword *cp* is entered in the *PARAMETER* data.
The minimum coverage of the sensitivity coefficients for the experiment
systems is defined as *senfac*\ × 100% of the application sensitivity in
the definition of :math:`N_{x,j}^{n}`. The value of *senfac* is set with the keyword input
*senfac=*, and the default value is 0.9. Thus, the experiment must have
a sensitivity coefficient at least 90% as great as that of the
application for the particular nuclide, reaction and energy group to
count in :math:`N_{x,j}^{n}`. The number of experiments counted in :math:`N_{x,j}^{n}` must be at least *nixlim*
to change *d* from 0 to 1, which indicates coverage for the particular
nuclide, reaction and group of the application. The value of *nixlim* is
set by the *nixlim=* keyword, and it has a default value of 10

.. _6-5-1-4-3:

Composite sensitivity data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A composite of the best available sensitivity data from all experiments
included in the analysis, based on the coverage criteria used for the
*G* integral index in :ref:`6-5-1-1-3` is produced for each application for each
nuclide-reaction pair in the *REACTIONS* input if the keyword *prtcomp*
is entered. The composite profile for a particular application *a* for
nuclide *n* and reaction *x* is defined as the vector


.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-16

  \mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{x}}^{\mathbf{a,n}}\equiv \left[ C_{x,j}^{a,n} \right] ]\],  j=1,..,J

where,

  :math:`C_{x,j}^{a,n}` is :math:`S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}` for the experiment that satisfies :math:`\text{min}\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n}-S_{x,j}^{{e}',n} \right|` :math:`e^{\prime}` = 1, ..., *E*,

.. math::

  S_{x,j}^{{e}',n}=\left\{ \begin{array}{*{35}{l}}
   S_{x,j}^{e,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|\ge \left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
   S_{x,j}^{a,n}\text{, where} & \left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|<\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|\text{  and }\frac{S_{x,j}^{a,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{a,n} \right|}=\frac{S_{x,j}^{e,n}}{\left| S_{x,j}^{e,n} \right|}  \\
   \text{0,} & \text{otherwise}  \\
  \end{array} \right.

..

  *a* represents a particular application,

  *e* represents a particular experiment,

  *n* represents a particular nuclide,

  *x* represents a particular reaction,

  *j* represents a particular energy group,

  *J* = number of energy groups, and

  *E* = number of experiments.

An example composite sensitivity profile for :sup:`1`\ H total is shown
in :numref:`fig6-5-3`. Here, the composite sensitivity profile comprised of
the best available data from unidentified experiments 1–5 is shown in
black. The sensitivity of the unidentified application is shown in red.
The areas where the red application curve exceeds the black composite
curve are considered uncovered. Areas where the experiment data exceed
the application data are considered fully covered. Note that the
composite data does not exceed the application data.

.. _fig6-5-3:
.. figure:: figs/TSUNAMI-IP/fig3.png
  :align: center
  :width: 500

  Example composite sensitivity profile.

If the composite data for a particular nuclide-reaction pair for a particular
energy group are added to the minimum difference data as defined in :eq:`eq6-5-13`,
the sensitivity of the application would result as

.. math::
  :label: eq6-5-17

  C_{x,j}^{a\mathbf{,}n}+Z_{x,j}^{a \mathbf{,}n}=S_{x,j}^{a\mathbf{,}n}

A sensitivity data file containing the composite sensitivity data is
generated to permit further analysis. Only data for those nuclides and
reaction identified in the *REACTIONS* input block are included in the
composite sensitivity data file. The data file is identified with the
TSUNAMI-IP input file name with the extension “.sdf” and is suitable for
use with Javapeño. This data file is presented as an interactive plot in
the HTML output. The following data are included on the composite
sensitivity data file for each nuclide-reaction pair identified in the
*REACTIONS* input block for each application: the sensitivity of the
application identified with “Application” and the application number,
the composite sensitivity data as defined in :eq:`eq6-5-16` , and the composite
profile used in the definition of the minimum difference profile from
the penalty calculation (:ref:`6-5-1-3`), which may be reduced from the
full composite by excluding experiments not meeting the cutoff criteria
for the penalty calculation. The composite data as used in the penalty
calculation are identified as “Cut Composite.”

.. _6-5-1-4-4:

Non-coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A summary of non-coverage for the nuclide-reaction pairs entered in the
*REACTIONS* section of the input can be produced if the keyword
*prtnotcv* is entered in the *PARAMETER* data. The non-coverage edit
gives the number of groups that are not fully covered according to the
*G* criteria and gives the sum of the non-covered portion of the
sensitivity coefficients. It also lists the group with largest
sensitivity, regardless of whether or not it is covered, and gives the
sensitivity value for this group. The experiment that best covers the
group with the maximum sensitivity is given and the sensitivity of this
group for the best matching experiment is given.

.. _6-5-1-5:

Miscellaneous options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several input parameters that provide a wide range of options in
TSUNAMI-IP are explained here. These keywords are entered in the
*PARAMETER* data block.

.. _6-5-1-5-1:

USLSTATS input files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

USLSTATS is a data regression tool described in Ref. D [6]_D. It is
included in the Windows version of SCALE and is available for download
from the SCALE website. The *uslstats* keyword requests input files for
USLSTATS to be generated from all integral indices computed by
TSUNAMI-IP. The *uslsummary* keyword requests USLSTATS input files to be
generated from all integral indices exceeding their particular
acceptance criteria (*cvalue, evalue,* and *gvalue*). The uncertainties
in the *k\ eff* values for USLSTATS can be adjusted with two options.
The default setting is that the uncertainty for each *k\ eff* value
included in the USLSTATS input file consists of the square root of the
sum of the squares of the Monte Carlo uncertainty and a uniform
experimental uncertainty of 0.3%. To quadratically add the uncertainty
in *k\ eff* due to cross-section-covariance data to this uncertainty,
enter the keyword *usl_uncert*. To modify the uniform experimental
uncertainty, use the *usl_sigs*\ =keyword. When a positive value is
entered for *usl_sigs*, this value is treated as the total uncertainty
for each experiment, and no other contributions, Monte Carlo or cross
section, are considered. When a negative value is entered for
*usl_sigs*, this value is treated as the experimental uncertainty for
each experiment and Monte Carlo and cross section uncertainties are
added as appropriate. Currently, no option exists to input a unique
experimental uncertainty for each experiment.

The USLSTATS input files contain the extension .usl and the filenames
are presented in a descriptive format as *title_xxxx_p_yyyy.usl*, where
*title* is the *filename* of the TSUNAMI-IP input case, *xxxx* is the
application number in the TSUNAMI-IP input, *p* is the name of the
integral index (*ck* for *c*\ :sub:`k`, *e* for *E*, and *g* for *G*), and
*yyyyy* is the TSUNAMI-IP execution number (typically 0001). When the
summary inputs are requested with *uslsummary*, the filename is of the
format *title_xxxx_p_sum_yyyy.usl*, where *sum* denotes that this
USLSTATS input file contains only the summary of experiments that exceed
the requested criteria for the specific integral index.

.. _6-5-1-5-2:

Covariance data directory listing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *prtmtrix* keyword causes a listing of the energy covariances of the
COVERX formatted cross-section data file, identified by *coverx=*, to be
printed.

.. _6-5-1-5-3:

HTML output
^^^^^^^^^^^

The keyword *html* causes TSUNAMI-IP to create an html formatted output.
This output edit is accessed by opening the *root*.html file, where
*root* is the name of the user’s input file without extensions.
Additional resources for the html output are placed in new directories
called *root*.htmd and *applet_resources*. The *root*.html directory
contains files needed to display data produced by the current case and
the *applet_resources* directory contains Java applets for data plotting
within the HTML interface and can be shared by multiple output files
within the same directory. The *root*.html file and associated
directories are placed in the same location as the user’s input file.
The html formatted output is color coded and more easily navigated than
the standard plain text formatted output file. The html output can be
customized with the *HTML* data block.

.. _6-5-1-5-4:

Case sensitive input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *inptcase* keyword sets a flag in the SCALE free form input reader
to prevent SCALE from translating all input to lower case. The purpose
of this keyword is the identification of file and directory names that
have upper case characters on a case-sensitive operating system. By
default, the SCALE input reader translates all text to lower case.
However, any input entered after *inptcase* is treated as case
sensitive. All subsequent keyword entries and data block names must be
entered in lower case, or errors will result.

.. _6-5-1-5-5:

Print filenames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *usename* keyword causes TSUNAMI-IP to identify files with their
file names in the code output. By default, TSUNAMI-IP identifies files
according to the title on the TSUNAMI-A or TSUNAMI-B sensitivity data
files. For files that have the same titles, or have long or
non-descriptive titles, *usename* can provide for simplified
interpretation of the output.

.. _6-5-1-5-6:

:math:`c_k` and *E* differences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The keywords *cechk=* and *cediff=* allow the user to input
discriminators that govern the output of warning messages when :math:`c_k`
and *E* values for a particular application and experiment differ by
more than *cediff* and :math:`c_k` and *E* are both at least as great as
*cechk.*

Plots
'''''

The keyword *plot* causes Javapeño formatted plot (.plt) files of the
global integral indices to be generated. A plot file containing all
computed integral index values for each application as a function of
experiment number is titled *rootxxxx.plt*, where *root* is the base
name of the input file and *xxxx* is the TSUNAMI-IP execution number
(typically 0001). Plot file containing the number of integral index
values that exceeded the acceptance criteria for each application is
titled *rootsummaryxxxx.plt*, where *summary* indicated it is a summary
plot. Both plots are displayed in the HTML output or can be view with
Javapeño. If the .plt files are opened in Javapeño with “Open Dataset…”
each set of data can be manually added to the plot as desired by the
user. If the .plt files are opened with “Open Plot…,” all data are
immediately displayed.

Absolute sensitivity option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All global indices and parameters can also be calculated using absolute
sensitivities. This capability is useful when working with
TSAR-generated reactivity sensitivity data files. TSAR creates a
sensitivity data file with reactivity sensitivities tabulated in either
relative format or absolute format (∆ρ/∣ρ∣)/∆σ/σ). If keyword *relative*
is specified in the PARAMETER block, any absolute reactivity
sensitivities are internally converted to (∆ρ)/∆σ/σ). (Note that the
reactivity sensitivity is normalized by ρ rather than ∣ρ∣. Normalizing
by ∣ρ∣ can potentially lead to :math:`c_k` and *E* indices with the wrong
sign.) Likewise, if the keyword *absolute* is specified, any relative
reactivity sensitivities are internally converted to (∆ρ/ρ)/∆σ/σ), and
the SAMS-generated relative *k\ eff\ ­* sensitivities are internally
converted to (∆*k\ eff*/*k\ eff*\ :sub:`)`/∆σ/σ). If both the *relative*
and *absolute* keywords are specified, the last keyword entered in the
PARAMETER block is used to determine the sensitivity format. If neither
keyword is entered, the default relative format is applied.

It is important to note that the absolute sensitivity option has been
added for user control over the format of the uncertainty edit and the
extended uncertainty edit. Using absolute sensitivities, the absolute
standard deviation in *k\ eff* or ρ is edited. Using relative
sensitivities, the relative standard deviation in *k\ eff* or ρ is
edited. The global indices :math:`c_k` and *E* are the same regardless of the
sensitivity format option. For other indices and parameters (i.e., *G*,
penalty assessment, and completeness parameter), their respective values
can change depending on sensitivity format option. These indices and
parameters play an important role in nuclear criticality safety
validation, and the default relative format option is recommended.

User input
~~~~~~~~~~

The user input for TSUNAMI-IP is described in this section. The input
consists of an optional title on a single line followed by one required
and six optional blocks of data which are identified in :numref:`tab6-5-1`
and individually described in subsequent subsections. These data blocks
must begin with **READ KEYNAME**\ and end with **END KEYNAME**, where
**KEYNAME** is the name of an individual data block. The required
PARAMETER data block should be entered first, followed by the remaining
blocks of data in any order. Note that this is different than the SCALE
5 and SCALE 5.1 versions of TSUNAMI-IP, which allowed the blocks of data
to be in any order. The SCALE 6 version will continue if the PARAMETER
data block is not entered first, but the keywords *absolute* and
*use_diff_groups* (explained below) will have no effect.

Parameter data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *PARAMETER* data block is used to request the calculation of the
various indices and parameters available in TSUNAMI-IP, request output
edits and set criteria values. The parameter block must begin with *READ
PARAMETER* and end with *END PARAMETER*. The data input to the parameter
data block consist of numerous keywords that are shown, along with their
default values and descriptions, in :numref:`tab6-5-2`. A keyword that ends
with *=* must be followed by numeric data. Keywords that do not end with
*=* are Boolean flags that are used to turn on certain features of the
code, such as the computation of certain data or certain output edits.
If the keyword is present for a Boolean entry, the value is set to true.
Otherwise, the Boolean flag is set to its default value. If no data are
requested in the *PARAMETER* section using the Boolean flags, then no
data will be produced by the code. The input is designed to maximize
user control over the operation of the code. A more detailed description
of the indices and parameters is given in :ref:`6-5-1-1` through :ref:`6-5-1-4`.

Reaction data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *REACTIONS* data block is used to specify nuclide-reaction pairs for
the *lg* and *lggroups* edits. The reactions block must begin with *READ
REACTIONS* and end with *END REACTIONS*. Data are entered in pairs with
the nuclide number (e.g., 92235) followed by the reaction MT number
(e.g., 18). Alphanumeric input is also accepted (e.g., u-235 fission)
for the nuclide-reaction pairs. Mixed input is also acceptable (e.g.,
92235 fission). Available reaction types are given in :numref:`tab6-5-4`.

.. _6-5-1-6-3:

User input covariance data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *COVARIANCE* data block allows the user to specify a covariance
matrix for specific nuclide-reaction pairs for which covariance data are
not present on the covariance data file or that have zero or large
values on the diagonal. The *COVARIANCE* data block must begin with
*READ COVARIANCE* and end with *END COVARIANCE*.

Any MT number or reaction name will be treated as a valid input, but
only those present on the sensitivity data files will produce useful
information. The reaction sensitivity types computed by SAMS from
TSUNAMI-1D and TSUNAMI-3D are shown in :numref:`tab6-5-4`. An
energy-covariance matrix is created for the specified nuclide-reaction
pair with the square of the entered standard deviation for the diagonal
terms for all groups using the *all=* value. Groups in the fast,
intermediate and thermal energies are then set to the square of the
standard deviation value entered for *fast=*, *inter=*, and *therm=*,
respectively. The off-diagonal terms of the energy matrix are generated
according to the input for *corr=*, and *corr_type=*, with default
settings of *1.0* and *zone.* Data entered in this block do not override
data present on the covariance data file. The SCALE 5.1 input format is
supported where data are entered in triplets with the nuclide name
(e.g., u-235), then the reaction MT number or name (e.g., 18 or
fission), and then a standard deviation value. In this case, the *end*
card must not be entered. The standard deviation value is applied to all
groups with default setting for correlations. These data are only used
if *use_icov* is specified in the *PARAMETER* data block.

If *use_icov* is specified, these data are used for the calculation of
the uncertainty in *k\ eff*\ (*uncert* and *uncert_long* edits),
calculation of |ck|, Extended |ck|, and the penalty assessment for
each application. These user input values are only applied where an
application has a sensitivity profile for which there is no
corresponding covariance matrix on the covariance data file. When both
*use_icov* and *cov_fix* are specified in the *PARAMETER* data block,
and a reaction has zero or large (standard deviation > 1000%) values on
the diagonal of the covariance matrix, these values are replaced with
the square of the user input standard deviation value, and the
corresponding off-diagonal terms are substituted according to the values
of *corr* and *corr_type*.

Specifying user input covariance data for the summative reactions total,
scatter and capture have no affect on the results of TSUNAMI-IP, as the
summative reactions are not used in uncertainty analysis calculations.


.. _6-5-1-6-4:

Application, experiment, and response data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sensitivity data files are designated as either application systems or
experiment systems by the *APPLICATIONS, EXPERIMENTS,* or *RESPONSE*
data blocks. For each application system, TSUNAMI‑IP will calculate
integral parameters against each experiment system. Each data block must
begin with *READ KEYNAME* and end with *END KEYNAME* where *KEYNAME* can
be *APPLICATIONS, EXPERIMENTS,* or *RESPONSE*.

Inside each data block, sensitivity data files are listed using response
definition records. A response definition record is a single line of
input that contains the sensitivity data filename and nine optional
keyword specifications. The sensitivity data filename and optional
keywords can be entered in any order, with the following format:

  *filename (name=N)(use=U)(type=T) (omit) (ev=E) (uv=U) (nu=P) (absolute
  or abs) (relative or rel)*

where

   *filename =* sensitivity data filename. The filename can include the
   file path.

   N *=* A descriptive identifier for the sensitivity data file in
   TSUNAMI-IP output edits. The identifier is limited to 20 alphanumeric
   characters (spaces are not allowed).

   U = The file usage. Allowed values are *appl, expt*, and *omit*,
   signifying the use of the file as an application or an experiment or
   to exclude the file from the analysis, respectively. The default
   values for the *use* keyword are described below.

   T = 8-character alphanumeric identifier for the response type (e.g.
   ‘\ *keff*\ ’). The response type is used in various output edits
   along with the *name=N* identifier.

   *omit* - Optional keyword used to omit *filename* from the analysis,
   can be used independent of *use*\ =.

   E = experimental value of the response (e.g. *k\ eff*).

   U = uncertainty value of the response.

   P = number of uncertainty components to characterize the experiment
   uncertainty for this response.

   *absolute* - Optional keyword that specifies absolute sensitivities
   will be used for *filename*.

   *relative* - Optional keyword that specifies relative sensitivities
   will be used for *filename*.

By default, filenames listed in the *APPLICATIONS* data block are
designated as application systems. Likewise, filenames listed in the
*EXPERIMENTS* or *RESPONSE* data blocks are designated as experiment
systems. The sensitivity data files must be in either the TSUNAMI-A or
TSUNAMI-B file format. The formats of these data files are detailed in
Appendix AH. Only the region-integrated sensitivity coefficients from
the sensitivity data files are used by TSUNAMI-IP. These data are
energy-dependent, but any mixture-dependent or region-dependent data
present on the data files are not used. Case-sensitive filenames and
their file paths are allowed. However, **spaces are not allowed in the
filenames or file paths.**

The nine optional keywords provide more user control over how each
sensitivity data file is used in the analysis, and how each sensitivity
data file is identified in the TSUNAMI-IP output. By default, TSUNAMI-IP
identifies files in the output according to the title on the sensitivity
data files. For files that have the same titles, or have long or
non-descriptive titles, the *usename* keyword in the *PARAMETER* data
block can be used to identify sensitivity data files by their filename.
Although file names are unique, they can also be non-descriptive. For
this reason, the *name* keyword on the response definition record can be
used to create a new identifier for the sensitivity data file in the
TSUNAMI-IP output. Similarly, the *type* keyword can be used to identify
the response type in the output. Because TSUNAMI-IP was initially
intended for similarity assessment of critical systems, the default
response type identifier is ‘\ *keff’*; the type identifier for
Generalized Perturbation Theory reaction rate sensitivity responses is
*‘gpt’*. For reactivity sensitivity data files produced by the TSAR
module (Chapter 6.4H), the default response type identifier is *‘rho’.*
The *type* keyword can be used to specify a descriptive response type
identifier, such as *type=k_sdm* or *type=alpha_t*.

The *use* keyword specifies how the sensitivity data file is used in the
analysis. Allowed values are *expt, appl,* or *omit*. All sensitivity
data files on response definition records with *use=expt* are designated
as experiment systems, regardless of what data block it is in. Likewise,
all sensitivity data files on response definition records with
*use=appl* are designated as application systems. In addition, the user
can omit the sensitivity data file from the analysis by entering either
*use=omit* or simply *omit* on the response definition record.

The experiment value of the response (*ev=*) and the experiment
uncertainty of the response (*uv=*) are used in generating USLSTATS
input files for trending analysis. If the experiment value is not
provided, the default value used in USLSTATS is 1.0. If the experiment
uncertainty value is not provided, the default used in USLSTATS is the
absolute value of the *usl_sigs* value in the *PARAMETER* data block.

The *ev=* and *uv=* keywords do not impact the computed results in
TSUNAMI-IP and are only used if the *uslstats* keyword is included in
the *PARAMETER* data block. Experiment values of *k\ eff* or reactivity
only need to be provided for experiment systems. TSUNAMI-IP skips over
*ev=* and *uv=* keyword specifications given for application or omitted
systems.

In addition to the *uv=* keyword specification, TSUNAMI-IP allows for
the experiment uncertainty value to be given in terms of uncertainty
components. The *nu=* keyword defines the number of uncertainty
components that characterize the experiment uncertainty. If the
experiment response uncertainty is given in terms of uncertainty
components, the *uv=* keyword specification is optional. An uncertainty
component definition record follows the response definition record if
the *nu=* keyword specification is given. The uncertainty component
definition record has the following format:

  *uncmp1 val1* *uncmp2 val2* ........ *uncmpP valP*

where

   *uncmp1 =*\ 4-character alphanumeric identifier for the 1\ :sup:`st`
   uncertainty component.

   *val1* =experiment uncertainty for component *uncmp1.*

   *uncmp2 =*\ 4-character alphanumeric identifier for the 2\ :sup:`nd`
   uncertainty component.

   *val2* =experiment uncertainty for component *uncmp2.*



   *uncmpP =*\ 4-character alphanumeric identifier for the P\ :sup:`th`
   uncertainty component.

   *valP* =experiment uncertainty for component *uncmpP.*

The uncertainty component definition record contains *nu=P* pairs of
alphanumeric identifiers and numeric values. The experiment uncertainty
value is determined by taking the square root of the sum of the squares
of each uncertainty component value.

The final optional keywords *abs* and *rel* are used to determine the
format of sensitivity and uncertainty data on the response definition
record and the uncertainty component definition record. For a *k\ eff*
response, the following four input definitions produce equivalent
uncertainties:

.. code:: none

  1)	name=exp_001 ev=1.001 uv=0.005000 rel C:\sensitivity\k_critical_a.sdf

  2)	name=exp_001 ev=1.001 uv=0.005005 abs C:\sensitivity\k_critical_a.sdf

  3)	name=exp_001 ev=1.001 nu=2        rel C:\sensitivity\k_critical_a.sdf
         enri 0.003000 sden 0.004000

  4)	name=exp_001 ev=1.001 nu=2        abs C:\sensitivity\k_critical_a.sdf
         enri 0.003003 sden 0.004004

In the example above, the measured *k\ eff* is 1.001 ± 0.5% or 1.001 ±
0.005005. The sensitivity data filename is given as
*C:\sensitivity\k_critical_a.sdf*, and the experiment response is
referred to as *exp_001* in the TSUNAMI-IP output. In 1), the *relative*
format is used to specify the relative standard deviation of the
measured response as 0.005. In 2), the *absolute* format is used to
specify the absolute standard deviation of the measured response as
0.005005. Because the TSUNAMI-generated sensitivity data file is in
relative format, TSUNAMI-IP internally renormalizes the relative
sensitivities to absolute sensitivities. In 3), the *relative* format is
used to specify the relative standard deviation of *k\ eff* due to two
components (*enri* and *sden*) as 0.003 and 0.004 respectively. Using
the square root of the sum of the squares approach, the relative
standard deviation of *k\ eff* is computed to be 0.005. In 4), the
*absolute* format is used to specify the absolute standard deviation of
*k\ eff* due to two components (*enri* and *sden*) as 0.003003 and
0.004004 respectively. The absolute standard deviation of *k\ eff* is
computed to be 0.005005. Like 2), the sensitivity data file is
internally converted to contain absolute sensitivities.

Because of the high-degree of flexibility in designating application
systems and experiment systems in the TSUNAMI-IP input, the following
two methods are recommended. The first method is consistent with
previous versions of TSUNAMI-IP. That is, application systems are listed
in the APPLICATIONS data block and experiment systems are listed in the
EXPERIMENTS data block. The second method would be to list both set of
systems in a single RESPONSE data block and use the *use=U* keyword
specification to designate how each file is to be used. Sample input
files for both methods are given for the TSUNAMI-IP example problem in
:ref:`6-5-1-6-7`.

Reactions excluded from |cr|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *EXCLUSIONS* data block contains lists of reaction types that will
be removed from consideration in the calculation of the |cr| integral
index and in the extended |cr| edit. Valid input for this block are
reaction MT numbers or names (e.g., 18 or fission). Values must be
separated by a space of a line break. Any MT number or reaction name
will be treated as a valid input, but only those present on the
sensitivity data files will produce useful information. The reaction
sensitivity types computed by SAMS from TSUNAMI-1D and TSUNAMI-3D are
shown in :numref:`tab6-5-4`.

.. _6-5-1-6-6:

HTML data
^^^^^^^^^

The optional *HTML* data block is used to customize HTML formatted
output. The *HTML* data block must begin with *READ HTML* and end with
*END HTML*. The data input to the *HTML* data block consist of several
keywords that are shown, along with their default values and
descriptions, in :numref:`tab6-5-5`. A keyword that ends with *=* must be
followed by text data. For color entries, any valid html color name can
be entered or the hexadecimal representation can be used if preceded by
a # sign. For example, to change the background color of the html output
to white, *bg_clr=white* and *bg_clr=#ffffff* have the same effect,
because ffffff is the hexadecimal representation of white. An extensive
list of available colors for customized output is shown in Appendix BH.

Example TSUNAMI-IP input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example TSUNAMI-IP input listing is given in :numref:`list6-5-1`. In this
example, the optional title for this analysis is entered as “tsunami-ip
example”. The parameter data are used to request that *E*, |ck|, *G*,
and *g* be computed (*e*, *c*, *g*, and *lg*, respectively).
The integral indices *E*, |ck|, and *G* will be listed in a table for
each application containing the values of each index for each experiment
(*values*). The cutoff values for *E* and |ck| for inclusion in the
summary tables are set to 0.8 (*evalue=0.8* and *cvalue=0.8*). Summary
tables listing experiments with *E* values exceeding *evalue*,
|ck|\ values exceeding *cvalue* will be produced (*esummary*, and
*csummary*, respectively). The *REACTIONS* data block requests that the
*n,γ* reaction for :sup:`235`\ U and the elastic scattering reaction for
:sup:`1`\ H be assessed for coverage with the *g* index.

The application systems are represented by the sensitivity data files
named 1sen.sdf, 2sen.sdf and 3sen.sdf. In this example input, these data
files are copied (or they could be linked in UNIX) to the temporary
directory where SCALE executes and writes its scratch files via system
commands that are input to the SHELL utility at the top of the input
file. In a typical SCALE installation on a PC, this directory is called
c:\scale6\tmpdir when running SCALE6 from the command line. On a UNIX
system, this directory is defined by the environment variable $TMPDIR
when executing scale6 or batch6 with the –t option. When executing
batch6 without the –t option, the temporary directory will change each
time batch6 is executed. The experiments for which the indices will be
computed for each application are listed in the *experiments* data
block. Here, an explicit file path is specified in the input. This could
also have been done in the APPLICATIONS data block. In this case, the 5
data files would have to exist in a directory called c:\sensitivity. An
equivalent input file using a single *RESPONSE* data block is given in
:numref:`list6-5-2`.

Example PROBLEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example problem to demonstrate the use of TSUNAMI-IP is based on the
TSUNAMI-1D and TSUNAMI-3D sample problems available with the SCALE
distribution. The systems included in the sample problem are not
intended to provide a rigorous demonstration of the methodologies of
TSUNAMI-IP, but merely to demonstrate how to use the software and read
the output. The problem does not correspond to the sample problem
distributed with SCALE and is included for illustrative purposes only.

.. _6-5-1-7-1:

Input description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example problem input listing is shown in :numref:`list6-5-3`. The input
begins with the SCALE shell module, which executes a series of copy
commands to move the sensitivity data files required for code execution
from the user’s directory (${root_dir} on Unix, %RTNDIR% on Windows) to
the current working directory. Next TSUNAMI-IP is called with
=tsunami-ip. The optional title card is entered as “tsunami-ip
example 2.” In the *PARAMETER* data block, the *values* table is
requested and it will contain |ck|, *E* and *G*, since *c e g* are
entered on the next line of input. The cutoff value for inclusion of
|ck| values in the summary table is set at 0.8 with *cvalue=0.8* and
the |ck| summary table is requested with *csummary*. The
nuclide-reaction specific integral indices extended |ck| and *g* are
requested with the input *c_long* and *lg*. The summary table of *g*
values exceeding the cutoff is requested with *lgsum*, and the cutoff
value for this table is set to 0.75 with *lgvalue=0.75.* The composite
sensitivity profiles for the reactions entered in the *REACTIONS* input
section are requested with *prtcomp*, and the summary of non-coverage
edit is requested with *prtnotcv*. The uncertainty in the *k\ eff*
values for the experiments and applications due to cross section
uncertainties is requested with *uncert* and the extended uncertainty
edits for the applications are requested with *uncert_long*. The penalty
assessment is requested with *penalty*, the minimum number of
experiments exceeding the global integral index; the cutoff value is set
to 0 with *penminx=0*. In this way, the limited number of experiments
used in this sample problem will still produce a penalty edit. The
detailed edit of the components of the penalty are requested with
*penlong*. The user-defined default value for covariance data are set to
100% uncertainty for cross sections without covariance data with
*udcov*\ =1.0. The *use_dcov* input keyword activates the use of the
*udcov* value in the computation of |ck| and the penalty assessment.
The use of filenames in place of the titles on the data files is
requested with *usename*.

This input defines two systems as applications in the *APPLICATIONS*
data block. The application systems are defined as the system with
sensitivity data in the data files tsunami-3d_k5-1.sdf and
tsunami-3d_k5-2.sdf. Three experiments are defined in the *EXPERIMENTS*
data block. These systems have sensitivity data in the data files
tsunami-1d1.sdf, tsunami-1d4.sdf, and tsunami-3d_k5-3.sdf.

Output Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output listings shown here are for descriptive purposes only. The
data generated from an actual execution of this problem may differ from
that shown below. The Applications List and the Experiments List provide
some details from the sensitivity data files. These include the title on
the data files, the filename, the number of energy groups and the number
of sensitivity profiles. After the Experiments List, Covariance Warnings
are printed during the creation of the working (i.e., problem-dependent)
covariance library. The nuclide-reactions pairs present on the
sensitivity data files for which covariance data are not available on
the *coverx* file are detailed. This edit is shown in :numref:`list6-5-5`.

The next output edit, shown in :numref:`list6-5-6` details the global integral
indices for the current application compared to all experiments. The
edit is only present if *values* is entered in the *PARAMETER* data
block. The first row of data in the table displays the application
compared to itself. This is useful to confirm the normalization of the
integral indices. The data detailing the application compared to itself
is not displayed in the HTML output. The next rows display the values of
the integral indices requested by the user for each experiment as
compared to the current application. The values of the response (i.e.,
*k\ eff* or reactivity) for the application and each experiment are also
shown in this table. If the sensitivity data were computed with
Monte Carlo methods, the statistical uncertainties are shown. In
:numref:`list6-5-6`, the *k\ eff* value for tsunami-1d1 does not show a
statistical uncertainty because these sensitivity data were computed
with TSUNAMI-1D. The integral values of the application compared to
tsunami-1d1 do show statistical uncertainties because the application
system was computed with TSUNAMI-3D. The column titles “xsec unc %”
gives the relative uncertainty in the response due to cross section data
uncertainties, in percent.

The next output edit is the extended uncertainty edit for the
application and is shown in :numref:`list6-5-7`. This edit details the
uncertainty in the response due to each nuclide-reaction to
nuclide-reaction covariance matrix. Where default or user input values
for covariance data are used, they are indicated in the output edit. The
total uncertainty can be computed from the individual values by squaring
each term, adding the values that had positive signs, subtracting the
values that had negative signs, then taking the square root. The edit is
present because *uncert_long* was included in the parameter input.

The next output edit is the extended |ck| edit, and an example edit
for Application 1 with Experiment 1 is shown in :numref:`list6-5-8`. This
edit details the contribution to |ck| due to each nuclide-reaction to
nuclide-reaction covariance matrix. Where default or user input values
for covariance data are used, they are indicated in the output edit. The
edit is present because *c_long* was included in the parameter input.
The |ck| value can be computed by summing the individual values.
Similar tables present the output for each application compared to each
experiment.

The next output edit includes the nuclide-reaction specific integral
indices and is shown in :numref:`list6-5-9`. In this sample problem,
*g* indices for fission capture and scatter reactions for each
nuclide-reaction pair with a sensitivity coefficient exceeding *sencut*
in magnitude are printed for each experiment compared to the
application. The first table of values is for the application compared
to itself. This initial edit is useful to test the normalization of the
integral indices for the application. This initial table of the
application compared with itself is not available in the HTML output.
The energy-integrated sensitivity coefficient for the application is
also shown for each reaction. Statistical uncertainties in these
integral values are not available in this version of TSUNAMI-IP. This
table is repeated for each experiment compared to the application.
Because some reactions were requested in the *REACTIONS* section of the
input, and the *g* integral index was computed, a table of the user
requested *g* values for the application compared to each experiment is
given. In this sample problem, :sup:`10`\ B was not present in the
application, even though it was requested in the input. TSUNAMI-IP lists
all requested reactions in this table, but leaves the values blank when
the nuclide or reaction is not available on the sensitivity data file
for the application.

The next output edit, shown in :numref:`list6-5-10`, gives the extended
penalty assessment for application 1. This edit is present because
*penlong* was entered in the parameter data block. The penalty edit
utilizes the user defined default uncertainties defined by *udcov*
because *use_dcov* was entered in the *PARAMETER* data block. Nuclide
reaction pairs that utilized default uncertainty data are indicated with
\*. In this case, when the sensitivity coefficients of the application
that are not covered by the experiments are propagated to an uncertainty
in the application response with the cross-section-covariance data value
of 0.0097% ± 0.00007% results. Next a listing of the contributions to
the penalty from each nuclide-reaction to nuclide-reaction covariance
matrix is given. As with the extended uncertainty edit, the cumulative
penalty can be computed from the individual values by squaring each
term, adding the values that had positive signs, subtracting the values
that had negative signs, then taking the square root.

Each of the previous edits would repeat in the full output listing for
each application. The next series of output edits, shown in
:numref:`list6-5-11`, are the summary edits requested by the user. The
|ck|  summary table, requested with the keyword *csummary*, indicates
that one experiment has a |ck| value at least as great as 0.8 compared
to each application. The *g* summary table lists the *g* values that
exceed *lgvalue* for the fission, capture and scatter reactions for each
nuclide in the application with an energy-integrated sensitivity
coefficient exceeding *sencut* in magnitude. The value of the
sensitivity coefficient for the application is also given. The summary
of non-coverage edit is present because *prtnotcv* was entered in the
*PARAMETER* input data block. This edit lists a number of properties of
each reaction input in the *REACTIONS* input data block. The final
summary table is the penalty summary table, which is activated when
*penalty* is listed in the *PARAMETER* data block. The penalties for all
applications identified in the *APPLICATIONS* input data block are
listed in the penalty summary table.

The composite sensitivity data are listed next in the TSUNAMI-IP output
as shown in :numref:`list6-5-12` The group-wise values for the composite
profiles for each nuclide-reaction pair identified in the *REACTIONS*
data block are listed here for each application identified in the
*APPLICATIONS* data block. If a reaction is requested that is not
present in the application, the reaction is left blank in the table, as
is the case in this sample problem for :sup:`10`\ B capture. The
composite sensitivity profiles are also written to a TSUNAMI-B formatted
sensitivity data file. In this data file, the composite sensitivity
profiles are written for each application in the order they were
requested in the *REACTIONS* data block. If a requested reaction is not
available in the application, it is not written to the data file. The
application number is listed on the data file in the position of the
material number but with a value that is the negative of the application
number. All unit and region information are entered as zeros as is the
*k\ eff* value. This data file can be correctly read by Javapeño such
that the composite data can be plotted. In Javapeño, the application
number appears in the list of available sensitivity profiles identified
as “composite.” The application sensitivity data and the composite data
as used in the penalty calculation are also included on the composite
sensitivity data file. These new data are identified as “application”
and “cut composite” respectively.

HTML output description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HTML formatted output from the TSUNAMI-IP sample problem is
described in this section. The HTML output is generated when the *html*
keyword is included in the *PARAMETER* block keyword The input for this
sample problem is named tsunami‑ip.input. In this case, the HTML
formatted output is stored in a file called tsunami-ip.html and
additional resources are stored in directories called tsunami‑ip.htmd
and applet_resources. These sections contain example TSUNAMI-IP HTML
formatted output only for demonstration of the interface. When
tsunami-ip.html is opened in a web browser, the information shown in
:numref:`fig6-5-16` is displayed. The title of the input file is displayed
between the two SCALE logos. Because this SCALE input file only executed
tsunami-ip, only a single output listing is available. The text “1.
TSUNAMI-IP” is a hyperlink to view the output from TSUNAMI-IP. Clicking
on the “1. TSUNAMI-IP” hyperlink will present the information shown in
:numref:`fig6-5-17`

  Initial screen from TSUNAMI-IP HTML output.


The initial page of output from TSUNAMI-IP is shown in :numref:`fig6-5-17`.
Program verification information is shown in the table under the TSUNAMI
logo. This table includes information about the code that was executed
and the date and time it was run. The menu on the left side of the
screen contains hyperlinks to specific portions of the code output.
Echoes of the input data are available in the Input Data section. Any
errors or warning messages are available in the Messages sections.
Results from the code execution are shown in the results section.

Selecting Input Parameters will reveal the menu of available input data.
Selecting Input Parameters causes the table shown in :numref:`fig6-5-18` to
be displayed. Other input data can also be displayed by selecting the
desired data from the menu.

  Input parameters from TSUNAMI-IP HTML output.

Selecting Messages will reveal a menu of available messages. Selecting
Warning Messages from the Messages section of the menu causes the
information shown in :numref:`fig6-5-19` to appear. The Warning Messages
edit contains all warning messages that were generated during the
execution of the code. If errors were encountered in the code execution,
an Error Messages item would have also been available in the menu under
Messages.

  Warning messages from TSUNAMI-IP HTML output.


Selecting Results causes a menu of available results to be revealed.
From this menu, selecting Global Integral Indices causes a submenu of
available global integral indices to be revealed. Selecting Integral
Index Values from this submenu causes the information shown in
:numref:`fig6-5-20` to appear. In certain results edits, a second menu
appears on the right such that the information for a particular
application can be quickly reached. The table shown in :numref:`fig6-5-20`
corresponds to the *values* table from the standard output file. One
advantage of the HTML output is the use of color coding. Values
exceeding the cutoff value for a particular integral index are printed
in the color that is set by the *HMTL* data block input *cut­­_clr=*.
The maximum value for each index for each application is printed in the
color that is set by the *HMTL* data block input *max­_clr=*. In this
case, the values that exceed the cutoff values are also the maximum
values and are colored as such. Edits for each type of data requested in
the *PARAMETER* data block are available in the results section by
selecting the appropriate submenu.

Data plots can also be directly viewed in the HTML output. The composite
data can be viewed by selecting Coverage and Completeness Assessment
then Composite Sensitivity Data Plot. A Java applet version of Javapeño
will appear in the browser window with the appropriate datafile
preloaded. Data can be added to the plot by double-clicking on the list
of available data on the right side of Javapeño. The plot shown in
:numref:`fig6-5-21` was produced with this procedure.

BONAMIST
--------

BONAMIST is a sensitivity version of the SCALE 4.4a BONAMI module.
BONAMI performs Bondarenko calculations for resonance self-shielding.
The entire FORTRAN 77 source for BONAMI was processed with the GRESS
pre-compiler so that the sensitivities of the self-shielded cross
sections to the data input to the code are computed. BONAMIST utilizes
many of the routines from SCALELIB. BONAMIST writes the resonance
self-shielded cross sections to an AMPX formatted data file, just as
BONAMI does. However, an additional data file, *bonamist.sen*, is also
written. The *bonamist.sen* file contains the sensitivities of resonance
self-shielded cross sections generated by BONAMIST to the quantities
input to BONAMIST.

The methodologies for computing the resonance self-shielded
cross sections in BONAMIST are identical to those used in BONAMI, and
equivalent cross-section results are obtained. The *bonamist.sen* data
file contains the sensitivity of the self-shielded cross sections to the
number density of each nuclide and the extra cross-section input to
BONAMIST. The extra cross section is used by TSUNAMI-1D, TSUNAMI‑3D,
CSAS and other SCALE sequences to pass the Dancoff factor computed in
MIPLIB or SENLIB to BONAMI. The format of the *bonamist.sen* data file
is given in Appendix A.

The input, output, methodologies and program flow of BONAMIST are not
described here. The user is referred to the BONAMI chapterH. The input
of BONAMIST is identical to that required for BONAMI. The sensitivities
are automatically computed and the *bonamist.sen* data file is
automatically generated without user intervention.
