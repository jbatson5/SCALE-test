KENO is a three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo criticality transport
program developed and maintained for use as part of the SCALE Code
System. It can be used as part of a sequence or as a standalone program.
There are two versions of the code currently supported in SCALE.
KENO V.a is the older of the two. KENO-VI contains all current KENO V.a
features plus a more flexible geometry package known as the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package. The geometry package in KENO-VI is capable
of modeling any volume that can be constructed using quadratic
equations. In addition, such features as geometry intersections, body
rotations, hexagonal and dodecahedral arrays, and array boundaries have
been included to make the code more flexible.

The simpler geometry features supported by KENO V.a allow for
significantly shorter execution times than KENO-VI, while the additional
geometry features supported in KENO-VI make the code appropriate for
cases where geometry modeling is not possible with KENO V.a. In
particular, KENO-VI allows intersections, body truncations with planes,
and a much wider variety of geometrical bodies. KENO-VI also has the
ability to rotate bodies so that volumes no longer must be positioned
parallel to a major axis. Hexagonal arrays are available in KENO-VI and
dohecahedral arrays enable the code to model pebble bed reactors and
other systems composed of close packed spheres. The use of array
boundaries makes it possible to fill a non-cuboidal volume with an
array, specifying the boundary where a particle leaves and enters the
array.

Except for geometry capabilities, the two versions of KENO share most of
the computational capabilities and the input flexibility specific to
most SCALE modules. They can both operate in multigroup or continuous
energy mode, run as standalone codes, or integrated in computational
sequences such as CSAS, TSUNAMI-3D, or TRITON. Both versions of the code
are continually updated and are written in FORTRAN 90.

Computational capabilities shared by the two versions of KENO include
the determination of k‑effective, neutron lifetime, generation time,
energy-dependent leakages, energy- and region-dependent absorptions,
fissions, the system mean-free-path, the region-dependent
mean-free-path, average neutron energy, flux densities, fission
densities, reaction rate tallies, mesh tallies, source convergence
diagnostics, problem-dependent continuous energy temperature treatments,
parallel calculations, restart capabilities, and many more.

Introduction to KENO
--------------------

KENO, a functional module in the SCALE system, is a Monte Carlo
criticality program used to calculate :math:`k_{eff}`, fluxes, reaction rates,
and other data for three-dimensional (3-D) systems. Special features
include multigroup or continuous energy mode, simplified data input, the
ability to specify origins for spherical and cylindrical geometry
regions, a P\ :sub:`n` scattering treatment, and restart capability.

The KENO data input features flexibility in the order of input. The only
restrictions are that the sequence identifier, title, and cross section
library must be entered first. A large portion of the data has been
assigned default values found to be adequate for many
problems. This feature enables the user to run a problem with a minimum
of input data.

In addition to the features listed above, KENO-VI uses the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package (SGGP), which contains a much larger set of
geometrical bodies, including cuboids, cylinders, spheres, cones,
dodecahedrons, elliptical cylinders, ellipsoids, hoppers,
parallelepipeds, planes, rhomboids, and wedges. The code’s flexibility
is increased by allowing: intersecting geometry regions; hexagonal,
dodecahedral, and cuboidal arrays; bodies and holes rotated to any angle
and translated to any position; and a specified array boundary that
contains only that portion of the array located inside the boundary.
Users should be aware that the added geometry features in KENO‑VI can
result in significantly longer run times than KENO V.a. A KENO-VI
problem that can be modeled in KENO V.a will typically run about four
times as long with KENO-VI as it does with KENO V.a. Therefore KENO-VI
is not a replacement for KENO V.a, but rather an additional version for
more complex geometries that could not be modeled previously.

Blocks of input data are entered in the form

**READ XXXX** *input_data* **END XXXX,**

where **XXXX** is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
types of data entered include parameters, geometry region data, array
definition data, biasing or weighting data, albedo boundary conditions,
starting distribution information, the cross section mixing table, extra
one-dimensional (1-D) (reaction rate) cross section IDs for special
applications, energy group boundaries for tallying in the continuous
energy mode, a mesh grid for collecting flux moments, and printer plot
information.

A block of data can be omitted unless it is needed or desired for the
problem. Within the blocks of data, most of the input is activated by
using keywords to override default values.

The treatment of the energy variable can be either multigroup or
continuous. Changing the calculation mode from multigroup to continuous
energy or vice versa is established by simply changing the cross section
library used. All available calculated entities in the multigroup mode
can also be calculated in the continuous energy mode. If the calculated
entity is energy or group dependent, it is automatically tallied into
the appropriate group structure in the continuous energy mode.

The KENO V.a geometry input consists of spheres, hemispheres, cylinders,
hemicylinders, and cuboids. Although the origin of the cylinders,
hemicylinders, spheres, and hemispheres is zero by default, they may be
specified to any value that will allow the geometry to fit in the
problem. This feature allows the use of nonconcentric cylindrical and
spherical shapes and provides a great deal of freedom in positioning
them. Another feature that expands the generality of the code is the
ability to place the cut surface of the hemicylinders and hemispheres at
any distance between the radius and the origin.

An additional convenience is the availability of an alternative method
for specifying the array definition unit-location data. This method uses
FIDO-like options for filling the array.

As mentioned above, KENO-VI uses the SGGP, which contains a much more
flexible geometry package than the one in KENO V.a. In KENO-VI, geometry
regions are constructed and processed as sets of quadratic equations. A
set of geometric shapes (including all of those used in KENO V.a plus
others) is available in KENO-VI, as well as the ability to build more
complex geometric shapes using sets of quadratic equations. Unlike
KENO V.a, KENO-VI allows intersections between geometry regions within a
unit, and it provides the ability to specify an array boundary that
intersects the array.

The most flexible KENO V.a geometry features are the
“\ **ARRAY**-of-**ARRAY**\ s” and “\ **HOLE**\ s” capabilities. The
**ARRAY**-of-**ARRAY**\ s option allows the construction of **ARRAY**\ s
from other **ARRAY**\ s. The depth of nesting is limited only by
computer space restrictions. This option greatly simplifies the setup
for **ARRAY**\ s involving different **UNIT**\ s at different spacings.
The **HOLE** option allows a **UNIT** or an **ARRAY** to be placed at
any desired location within a geometry region. The emplaced **UNIT** or
**ARRAY** cannot intersect any geometry region and must be wholly
contained within a region. As many **HOLE**\ s as will snugly fit
without intersecting can be placed in a region. This option is
especially useful for describing shipping casks and reflectors that have
gaps or other geometrical features. Any number of **HOLE**\ s can be
described in a problem, and **HOLE**\ s can be nested to any depth.

The primary difference between the KENO V.a and KENO-VI geometry input
is the methodology used to represent the geometry/material regions in a
unit. KENO-VI uses two geometry records (cards) to describe a region.
The first record, called the GEOMETRY record, contains the geometry
(**shape**) keyword, region boundary definitions, and any geometry
modification data. Using geometry modification data, regions can be
rotated and translated to any angle and position within a unit. The
second record, the **CONTENT** record, contains the **MEDIA** keyword;
the material, **HOLE**, or **ARRAY** ID number; the bias ID number; and
the region definition vector. KENO-VI requires that a **GLOBAL UNIT** be
specified in all problems, including single unit problems.

In addition to the *cuboidal* **ARRAY**\ s available in KENO V.a,
*hexagonal* **ARRAY**\ s and *dodecahedral* **ARRAY**\ s can be directly
constructed in KENO-VI. Also, the ability to specify an **ARRAY**
boundary that intersects the **ARRAY** makes it possible to construct a
lattice in a cylinder using one **ARRAY** in KENO-VI instead of multiple
**ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s as would be required in KENO V.a.

Anisotropic scattering is treated by using discrete scattering angles.
The angles and associated probabilities are generated in a manner that
preserves the moments of the angular scattering distribution for the
selected group-to-group transfer. These moments can be derived from the
coefficients of a P\ :sub:`n` Legendre polynomial expansion. All moments
through the 2n − 1 moment are preserved for n discrete scattering
angles. A one-to-one correspondence exists such that n Legendre
coefficients yield n moments. The cases of zero and one scattering angle
are treated in a special manner. Even when the user specifies multiple
scattering angles, KENO can recognize that the distribution is
isotropic, and therefore KENO selects from a continuous isotropic
distribution. If the user specifies one scattering angle, the code
selects the scattering angle from a linear function if it is positive
between -1 and +1, and otherwise it performs semicontinuous scattering
by picking scattering angle cosines uniformly over some range between –1
and +1. The probability is zero over the rest of the range.

The KENO restart option is easy to activate. Certain changes can be made
when a problem is restarted, including using a different random sequence
or turning off certain print options such as fluxes or the fissions and
absorptions by region.

KENO can also compute angular fluxes and flux moments in multigroup
calculations, which are required to compute scattering terms for
generation of sensitivity coefficients with the SAMS module or the
TSUNAMI-3D control module. Fluxes can also be accumulated in a Cartesian
mesh that is superimposed over the user-defined geometry in an automated
manner.

KENO can perform Monte Carlo transport calculations concurrently on a
number of computational nodes. By introducing a simple master-slave
approach via MPI, KENO runs different random walks concurrently on the
replicated geometry within the same generation. Fission source and other
tallied quantities are gathered at the end of each generation by the
master process and are then processed either for final edits or
subsequent generations. Code parallel performance is strongly dependent
on the size of the problem simulated and the size of the tallied
quantities.

KENO Data Guide
---------------

KENO may be run stand alone or as part of a SCALE criticality safety or
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sequence. If KENO is run stand
alone in the multigroup mode, cross section data can be used from an
AMPX :cite:`dunn_ampx-2000_2002` working format library or from a Monte Carlo format cross
section library. If KENO uses an AMPX working format library, a mixing
table data block must be entered. If a Monte Carlo format library is
used, a mixing table data block is not entered, and the mixtures
specified in the KENO geometry description must be consistent with the
mixtures created on the Monte Carlo format library file.

If KENO is run stand alone in the continuous energy mode, a mixing table
data block must be provided unless the restart option is used.

If KENO is run as part of a SCALE criticality safety or sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis sequence, the mixtures are defined in the CSAS or
TSUNAMI-3D input, and a mixing table data block cannot be entered in
KENO. Furthermore, the mixture numbers used in the KENO geometry
description must correspond to those defined in the composition data
block of the CSAS or TSUNAMI-3D input. To use a cell-weighted mixture in
KENO, the keyword “\ **CELLMIX**\ =,” followed by a unique mixture
number, must be specified in the unit cell data of the CSAS or
TSUNAMI‑3D sequence. Unit cell data are applicable only in the
multigroup mode. The mixture number used in the KENO input is the unique
mixture number immediately following the keyword “\ **CELLMIX**\ =.” A
cell‑weighted mixture is available only in SCALE sequences that use
XSDRN to perform a cell-weighting calculation using a multigroup cross
section library. :numref:`tab8-1-1` through :numref:`tab8-1-14` summarize the KENO
input data blocks. These input data blocks are discussed in detail in
the following sections.

In order to run KENO parallel (standalone execution), the user must
provide a name with the “%” prefix in the input file (=%kenovi). Control
modules like CSAS, TRITON, and TSUNAMI-3D automatically initiate
parallel KENO execution if the user provides the required arguments
while running this code.

Keno input outline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data input for KENO is outlined below. Default data for KENO have
been found to be adequate for many problems. These values should be
carefully considered when entering data.

Blocks of input data are entered in the form:

**READ XXXX** *input_data* **END XXXX**

where **XXXX** is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
keywords that can be used are listed in Table 8.1.15. A minimum of four
characters is required for a keyword, and some keyword names may be as
long as twelve characters (**READ PARAMETER**, **READ GEOMETRY**, etc.).
Keyword inputs are not case sensitive. Data input is activated by
entering the words **READ XXXX** followed by one or more blanks. All
input data pertinent to **XXXX** are then entered. Data for **XXXX** are
terminated by entering **END XXXX** followed by two or more blanks. Note
that multiple **READ GRID** blocks are used if multiple grid definitions
are needed.

Three data records **must** be entered for every problem: first the
SCALE sequence identifier, then the problem title, and then the **END
DATA** to terminate the problem.

(1) KENO is typically run using one of the SCALE CSAS or TSUNAMI
sequences, but it may also be run stand alone using KENO V.a or KENO-VI.
The sequence identifier is specified using one line similar to:

=kenovi

This line may also include additional runtime directives that are
described throughout the SCALE manual. For example:

=kenova parm=check

The following guidance generally assumes the user is running KENO stand
alone. If KENO is to be run using of the other sequences (e.g., CSAS5),
see the appropriate manual section for additional guidance.

(2) **problem title**

   Enter a problem title (limit 80 characters, including blanks; extra
   characters will be discarded). A title **must be entered**.
   See Sect. 8.1.2.3.

(3) **READ PARA** *parameter_data* **END PARA**

   Enter parameter input as needed to describe a problem. If parameter
   data are desired in standalone KENO calculations (i.e., non-CSAS),
   they must immediately follow the problem title. Default values are
   assigned to all parameters. A problem **can** be run without entering
   any parameter data if the default values are acceptable.

   Parameter data must begin with the words **READ PARA**, **READ
   PARM**, or **READ PARAMETER.** Parameter data may be entered in any
   order. If a parameter is entered more than once, the last value is
   used. The words **END PARA** or **END PARM**, or **END PARAMETER**
   terminate the parameter data. See :ref:`8-1-2-3`.

(n\ :sub:`1`)...( n\ :sub:`13`) The following data may be entered in any
order. Data not needed to describe the problem may be omitted.

(n\ :sub:`1`) **READ GEOM** *all_geometry_region_data* **END GEOM**

Geometry region data must be entered for every problem that is not a
restart problem. Geometry data must begin with the words **READ GEOM**
or **READ GEOMETRY**. The words **END GEOM** or **END GEOMETRY**
terminate the geometry region data. See :ref:`8-1-2-4`.

(n\ :sub:`2`) **READ ARRA** *array_definition_data* **END ARRA**

   Enter array definition data as needed to describe the problem. Array
   definition data define the array size and position units (defined in
   the geometry data) in a 3-D lattice that represents the physical
   problem being analyzed. Array data must begin with the words **READ
   ARRA** or **READ ARRAY** and must terminate with the words **END
   ARRA** or **END ARRAY**. See :ref:`8-1-2-5`.

(n\ :sub:`4`) **READ BOUN** *albedo_boundary_conditions* **END BOUN**

   Enter albedo boundary conditions as needed to describe the problem.
   Albedo data must begin with the words **READ BOUN, READ BNDS**,
   **READ BOUND**, or **READ BOUNDS,** and it must terminate with the
   words **END BOUN**, **ENDS BNDS**, **END BOUND**, or **END BOUNDS**.
   See :ref:`8-1-2-6`.

(n\ :sub:`3`) **READ BIAS** *biasing_information* **END BIAS**

   The *biasing_information* is used to define the weight given to a
   neutron surviving Russian roulette. Biasing data must begin with the
   words **READ BIAS**. The words **END BIAS** terminate the biasing
   data. See :ref:`8-1-2-7`.

(n\ :sub:`5`) **READ STAR** *starting_distribution_information* **END
STAR**

   Enter starting information data for starting the initial source
   neutrons only if a uniform starting distribution is undesirable.
   Start data must begin with the words **READ STAR, READ STRT** or
   **READ START**, and it must terminate with the words **END STAR**,
   **END STRT** or **END START**. See :ref:`8-1-2-8`.

(n\ :sub:`6`) **READ ENER** *energy_group_boundaries* **END ENER**

   Enter upper energy boundaries for each neutron energy group to be
   used for tallying in the continuous energy mode. Energy bin data
   begin with the words **READ ENER** or **READ ENERGY** and terminate
   with the words **END ENER** or **END ENERGY**. The last entry is the
   lower energy boundary of the last group. The values must be in
   descending order. This block is only applicable to continuous energy
   KENO calculations. See :ref:`8-1-2-12`.

(n\ :sub:`7`) **READ MIXT** *cross_section_mixing_table* **END MIXT**

   Enter a mixing table to define all the mixtures to be used in the
   problem. The mixing table must begin with the words **READ MIXT** or
   **READ MIX** and must end with the words **END MIXT** or **END MIX**.

Procedure for data input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a standalone KENO problem, the first data records **must** be the
sequence identifier (e.g., =kenovi or =kenova) and the title. The next
block of data **must** be the parameters if they are to be entered. A
problem can be run without entering the parameters, which causes KENO to
use default values for input parameters. The remaining blocks of data
can be entered in any order.

   **BOLD TYPE** specifies keywords. A keyword is used to identify the
   data that follow it. When a keyword is used, it must be entered
   exactly as shown in the data guide. All keywords except those ending
   with an equal sign must be followed by at least one blank.

   *small_italics* correlate data with a program variable name. The
   actual values are entered in place of the program variable name and
   are terminated by a blank or a comma.

   *CAPITAL ITALICS* identify general data items. General data items are
   general classes of data including

   (1) geometry data such as *UNIT INITIALIZATION* and *UNIT NUMBER
   DEFINITION, GEOMETRY REGION DESCRIPTION, GEOMETRY WORD, MIXTURE
   NUMBER, BIAS ID,* and *REGION DIMENSIONS*,

   (2) albedo data such as *FACE CODES* and *ALBEDO NAMES*,

(3) weighting data such as *BIAS ID NUMBERS*, etc.

   Square brackets The square brackets, [ and ], are used to show that
   an entry is optional.

   Broken line The broken line, \|, is used as a logical “or” symbol to
   show that the entries to its left and right are alternatives that
   cannot be used simultaneously.

Title and parameter data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *title*, a character string, must be entered at the top of the input
file. The syntax is:

*title* a string of characters with a length of up to 80 characters,
including blanks.

The **PARAMETER** block may contain parameter initializations for those
parameters that need to be changed from their default value. The syntax
for the **PARAMETER** block is:

**READ** **PARA**\ [**METER**] *p\ 1 … p\ N* **END**
**PARA**\ [**METER**]

or

**READ** **PARM** *p\ 1 … p\ N* **END** **PARM**

*p\ 1 … p\ N* are *N* (*N* greater than or equal to zero) keyworded
parameters that together make up the *PARAMETER DATA*

The commonly changed parameters are **TME**\ *,* **GEN**\ *,* **NSK**,
and **NPG**. Seldom changed parameters are **NBK**\ *,* **NFB**\ *,*
**XNB**\ *,* **XFB**\ *,* **WTH**\ *,* **WTL**\ *,* **TBA**\ *,*
**BUG**\ *,* **TRK**\ *,* and **LNG**.

  0.0 (no limit).

  **TBA** = *tbtch* time allotted for each generation (in minutes),
  default = 10 minutes. If *tbtch* is exceeded in any generation, the
  problem is assumed to be looping. Execution is terminated, and final
  edits are performed. The problem can loop indefinitely on a computer if
  the system-dependent routine to interrupt the problem (PULL) is not
  functional. **TBA=** is also used to set the amount of time available
  for generating the initial starting points.

  **SIG** = *tsigma* if entered and > 0.0, this is the standard deviation
  at which the problem will terminate, default = 0.0, which means do not
  check sigma.

  **WTA** = *dwtav* the default average weight given a neutron that
  survives Russian roulette, *dwtav* default = 0.5.

  **WTH** = *wthigh* the default value of *wthigh* is 3.0 and should be

  which splitting occurs is defined to be *wthigh x wtavg*, where *wtavg*
  is the weight given to a neutron that survives Russian roulette.

  **WTL** = *wtlow* Russian roulette is played when the weight of a
  neutron is less than *wtlow x wtavg*. The *wtlow* default =
  1.0/\ *wthigh*.

  **MSH** = *mesh_size* Length (cm) of one side of a cubic mesh for
  tallying fluxes. Default = 0.0. A positive non-zero value must be
  entered if **MFX**\ =YES and **READ GRID** input is not entered.

  **TTL =** *temperature_tolerance* The continuous energy cross sections
  must be within the *temperature_tolerance* (in degrees Kelvin) of the

  *npb* + 25.

  0, which means do not collect. Angular fluxes are typically only needed
  for TSUNAMI-3D calculations.

  **NGP** = *ngp* number of neutron energy groups to be used for tallying
  in the continuous energy mode. If *NGP* corresponds to a standard SCALE
  group structure, then the SCALE group structure will be used. If it does
  not correspond to a standard structure, an equally spaced in lethargy
  group structure will be used. If nothing is specified for a continuous
  energy problem, the SCALE 238 group structure will be used.

  **PNM** = *isctr* highest order of flux moment tallies, default = 0.
  Flux moments are typically only tallied for TSUNAMI-3D calculations.

  **CET** = *ce_tsunami_mode*.
  mode for CE TSUNAMI (See TSUNAMI-3D manual).

     :sup:`239`\ Pu, :sup:`240`\ Pu)

  **DBX** = *db_xs_mode*

  option for performing problem-dependent or on-the-fly Doppler
  Broadening. See Sect. 8.1.6.2.10 for more details. Default = 2.

     0 = No problem-dependent or on-the-fly Doppler Broadening

     1 = Perform problem-dependent Doppler Broadening for 1D cross

.. note:: The parameters RUN and PLOT can also be entered in the PLOT
  data. See Sect. 8.1.2.11. It is recommended that these parameters be
  entered only in the parameter data in order to ensure that the data
  printed in the Logical Parameters table is actually performed. If RUN
  and/or PLT are entered in both the parameter data and plot data, the
  results vary depending on whether the problem is run (1) stand alone,
  (2) as a restarted problem, (3) as CSAS with parm=check, or (4) as CSAS
  without parm=check. These conditions are detailed below.

KENO standalone and CSAS with PARM=CHECK
  The values of RUN and/or PLT entered in KENO parameter data are printed in the Logical Parameters table of the problem output. However, values for RUN and/or PLT entered in the **KENO plot data** will override the values entered in the parameter data.

Restarted KENO
  The values of RUN and/or PLT printed in the Logical Parameters table of the problem output are the final values from the parent problem unless those values are overridden by values entered in the **KENO parameter data** of the restarted problem. If the problem is restarted at generation 1, **KENO plot data** can be entered, and the values for RUN and/or PLT will override the values printed in the Logical Parameters table.

CSAS Without PARM=CHECK
  The values of RUN and/or PLT entered in the KENO parameter data override values entered in the KENO plot data. The values printed in the Logical Parameters table control whether the problem is to be executed and whether a plot is performed.

Parameters that are either Integer or Logical

**SCD**\ = *lScnvgDiag* enable fission source convergence diagnostics
(ScnvgDiag), default=YES. See Sect. 8.1.6.7for further details.

**CDS** = *lcadis/lGridFissions* accumulate neutron fissions to use as
fission source in subsequent MAVRIC/Monaco shielding calculation or for
visualization, default = NO

**GFX** = *lGridFlux* compute grid fluxes averaged over the volume of
the mesh on intervals defined by a READ GRID data block, default = NO.

**MFX** = *lMeshFlux* compute mesh fluxes averaged over the volume of
mixtures/materials in a mesh on intervals defined by **MSH** above or by
READ GRID data block, default = NO.

**CGD** = *lStarMesh* grid ID for the *F*\ :sup:`\*`\ (r) mesh for
continuous energy CLUTCH sensitivity calculations. This mesh is defined
in the **READ GRID** data block, default = NO.

.. note::  The KENO codes in previous SCALE versions allowed for only one
  mesh definition in the user input with either MSH parameter or **READ
  GRID** data block, and (2) calculation of a single mesh-based quantity,
  such as **MFX** (mesh fluxes) or **CDS** (fission source accumulation on
  a mesh), per KENO simulation.

  The option to define multiple spatial meshes during a single simulation
  has been implemented in the KENO codes to add flexibility to mesh-based
  quantity calculations. The new implementation requires that each mesh
  definition in the **READ GRID** block should have a unique NUMBER (grid
  ID), which is used for mesh assignment. Users can assign any number of
  mesh-based quantities by setting the mesh parameters **SCD**, **CDS**,
  **GFX**, **MFX** and **CGD** to this grid NUMBER.

  To support these former and new definition formats, the parameters
  **SCD**, **CDS**, **GFX**, **MFX** and **CGD** have been redesigned to
  allow either integer or logical entries. Integer entries are required if
  multiple mesh-based quantities are requested by the user. In this case,
  each integer entry must point to a grid ID specified in any **READ
  GRID** data block. See Sect. 8.1.2.14. for several examples for the use
  of these parameter definitions. These entries are detailed below.

   **SCD**\ =yes Enable source convergence diagnostics using the fission
   source accumulation on the default mesh, which is 5 × 5 × 5 Cartesian
   mesh overlaying the whole problem geometry, generated automatically.
   See Sect. 8.1.6.7.

   **SCD**\ =\ *id* Enable source convergence diagnostics using the
   fission source accumulation on the mesh defined with **READ GRID**
   data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **MFX**\ =yes Compute mesh fluxes (fluxes averaged over each region
   volume in a voxel) on intervals defined by **MSH** above or by the
   first specified **READ GRID** data block.

   **MFX**\ =\ *id* Compute mesh fluxes on intervals defined by the
   **READ GRID** data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **CDS**\ =yes Accumulate fission sources on intervals defined by the
   first specified **READ GRID** data block.

   **CDS**\ =\ *id* Accumulate fission source on intervals defined by
   the specified **READ GRID** data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **GFX**\ =\ *id* Compute grid fluxes (fluxes averaged over a voxel
   volume) on intervals defined by the READ GRID data block with grid
   ID, *id*.

   **CGD**\ =\ *id* Enable a mesh grid defined by the READ GRID data
   block with grid ID, id for CLUTCH :math:`F^{*}\left( r \right)`
   calculations.

   All of the above quantities may be requested in a single input using
   either the same or different grids. See Sect. 8.1.2.14 for further
   details.

I/O Unit Numbers

  **XSC** = *xsecs* I/O unit number for a Monte Carlo format mixed cross
  section library. When LIB≠0, default = 14. To read a mixed cross section
  library from a Monte Carlo format library file or CSASI, XSC must be
  specified.

  **ALB** = *albdo* I/O unit number for albedo data, default = 79.

  **WTS** = *wts* I/O unit number for weights, default = 80.

  **LIB** = *lib* I/O unit number for *AMPX* working format cross section
  library, default = 0.

  **SKT** = *skrt* I/O unit number for scratch space, default = 16.

  **RST** = *rstrt* I/O unit number for reading restart data, default = 0.

  Enter a logical unit number to restart if *BEG* > 1.

  **WRS** = *wstrt* I/O unit number for writing restart data, default = 0.

     A non-zero value must be entered if *RES* > 0.

  **GRP** = *grpbs* I/O unit number for an energy group boundary library,
  default = 77.

Geometry data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *GEOMETRY\_ DATA* consists of a series of **UNIT** descriptions, one
of which may be the **GLOBAL UNIT**. The **UNIT** is the basic geometry
piece in KENO and often corresponds to a well-defined physical entity
(e.g., a fuel pin). A **UNIT**, therefore, may consist of multiple
*material regions*. Each **UNIT** has its own, local coordinate system.
The **UNIT**\ s are assembled to construct the problem’s global geometry
for KENO. The *GEOMETRY\_ DATA* must be entered unless the problem is
being restarted. See :ref:`8-1-3-6` for detailed examples.

UNITS
^^^^^

Geometric arrangements in KENO are achieved in a manner similar to using
a child’s building blocks. Each building block is called a **UNIT**. An
**ARRAY** or lattice is constructed by stacking these **UNIT**\ s. Once
an **ARRAY** or lattice has been constructed, it can be placed in a
**UNIT** by using an **ARRAY** specification.

Each **UNIT** in an **ARRAY** or lattice has its own coordinate system.
In KENO V.a, all coordinate systems in all **UNIT**\ s must have the
same orientation. This restriction is removed in KENO-VI. All geometry
data used in a problem are correlated to the absolute coordinate system
by specifying a **GLOBAL UNIT**. **UNIT**\ s are constructed of
combinations from several allowed **shape**\ s or geometric regions.
These regions can be placed anywhere within a **UNIT**. In KENO V.a the
regions are oriented along the coordinate system of the **UNIT** and do
not intersect other regions. This means, for example, that a
**CYLINDER** must have its axis parallel to one of the coordinate axes,
while a rectangular parallelepiped must have its faces perpendicular to
a coordinate axis. The most stringent KENO V.a geometry restriction is
that none of the options allow geometry regions to intersect. In KENO
V.a, each region in a unit must entirely contain each preceding region.
The orientation, intersection, and containment restrictions are
eliminated in KENO-VI. :numref:`fig8-1-1` shows some situations that are not
allowed in KENO V.a, but are allowed in KENO-VI.

.. _fig8-1-1:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig1.png
  :align: center

  Examples of geometry allowed in KENO-VI but not allowed in KENO V.a.

For KENO V.a, unless special options are invoked, each geometric region
in a **UNIT** must completely enclose each interior region. Regions may
touch at points of tangency and may share faces. See :numref:`fig8-1-2` for
examples of allowable situations.

.. _fig8-1-2:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig2.png
  :align: center

  Examples of correct KENO V.a units.

Special options are provided to circumvent the complete enclosure
restriction in KENO V.a or to enhance the basic geometry package in
KENO-VI. These options include **ARRAY** and **HOLE** descriptions. The
**HOLE** option is the simplest of these and allows placing a **UNIT**
anywhere within a region of another **UNIT.** In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s
are not allowed to intersect the region into which they are placed; this
restriction does not apply in KENO-VI (see :numref:`fig8-1-3`). In both geometry
packages, a **HOLE** cannot intersect the **UNIT** boundary. It is
recommended that the outer boundary of a **UNIT** used as a **HOLE**
should not be tangent to or share a boundary with another **HOLE** or a
region of the **UNIT** containing the **HOLE** because the code may find
that the regions are intersecting due to precision and round-off. Since
a particle must check every region to determine its location within a
**UNIT**, using **HOLE**\ s to contain complex sections of a problem may
decrease the CPU time needed for the problem in KENO-VI. Inclusion of
**HOLE**\ s increases run-time in KENO V.a, but in many cases cannot be
avoided. An arbitrary number of **HOLE**\ s can be placed in a region in
combination with a series of surrounding regions. The only restrictions
on **HOLE**\ s are (1) when they are placed in a **UNIT,** they must be
entirely contained within the **UNIT**, and (2) they cannot intersect
other **HOLE**\ s or nested **ARRAY**\ s. **HOLE**\ s in KENO V.a cannot
intersect an **ARRAY**; in KENO-VI, the **HOLE** cannot intersect the
**ARRAY** boundary.

  Example demonstrating HOLE capability in KENO.

Lattices or arrays are created by stacking **UNIT**\ s. In KENO V.a,
only rectangular parallelepipeds can be organized in an **ARRAY**.
**HEXPRISM**\ s and **DODECAHEDRON**\ s are allowed in KENO-VI to
construct triangular pitched or closed-packed dodecahedral **ARRAY**\ s,
respectively. The adjacent faces of adjacent **UNIT**\ s stacked in this
manner must match exactly. See :ref:`8-1-3-6-4` for additional
clarification and :numref:`fig8-1-4` and :numref:`fig8-1-5` for typical examples.

  Example of ARRAY construction.

The **ARRAY** option is provided to allow for placing an **ARRAY** or
lattice within a **UNIT**. In KENO-VI, an **ARRAY** is placed in a
**UNIT** by inserting it directly into a geometry/material region as a
content record. In KENO V.a, the **ARRAY** is placed directly in the
unit like a **CUBOID**: it must be the first region in the **UNIT**, or
the **ARRAY** elements must intersect with the smaller region.
Subsequent regions in the **UNIT** containing the **ARRAY** must contain
it entirely. In KENO-VI, the reverse is true: the region boundary
containing the **ARRAY** must coincide with or be contained within the
**ARRAY** boundary. Therefore, in KENO-VI the region boundary becomes
the **ARRAY** boundary, with the problem ignoring any part of the
**ARRAY** outside the boundary. A particle enters or leaves the
**ARRAY** when the region boundary is crossed. In KENO V.a, only one
**ARRAY** can be placed directly in a UNIT. However, multiple
**ARRAY**\ s can be placed within a **UNIT** by using **HOLE**\ s. When
an **ARRAY** is placed in a **UNIT** via a **HOLE**, the **UNIT** that
contains the **ARRAY** (rather than the **ARRAY** itself) is placed in
the **UNIT**. **ARRAY**\ s of dissimilar **ARRAY**\ s can be created by
stacking **UNIT**\ s that contain **ARRAY**\ s. In KENO-VI, it is
possible to place multiple **ARRAY**\ s in a **UNIT** by placing them in
separate regions. Also in KENO-VI, using **HOLE**\ s to insert
**ARRAY**\ s allows the **ARRAY**\ s to be rotated when placed. See
:numref:`fig8-1-6` for an example of an **ARRAY** composed of **UNIT**\ s
containing **HOLE**\ s and **ARRAY**\ s.

The method of entering *GEOMETRY_DATA* in the geometry data block
follows:

**READ GEOM** *GEOMETRY\_ DATA* **END GEOM**

UNIT initialization
...................

The description of a **UNIT** starts out with the **UNIT**
*INITIALIZATION* and is terminated by encountering another **UNIT**
*INITIALIZATION* or **END GEOM**.

The **UNIT** *INITIALIZATION* has the following format:

[**GLOBAL**] **UNIT** *u*

*u* is the identification number (positive integer) assigned to the
particular **UNIT**. It may be used later to reference a **UNIT**
previously constructed that the user wishes to place in a **HOLE**, or
it may be used in an **ARRAY** (see below for more details).

**GLOBAL** is an attribute that specifies that the respective **UNIT**
is the most comprehensive **UNIT** in the KENO problem to be solved, the
**UNIT** that includes all the other **UNIT**\ s and defines the overall
geometric boundaries of the problem. In general, a \ **GLOBAL UNIT**
must be entered for each problem.

   In KENO V.a, the **GLOBAL** specification is optional. If it is used,
   it can precede either a **UNIT** command or an **ARRAY**
   *PLACEMENT_DESCRIPTION*. If it is not entered and the problem does
   not contain **ARRAY** data, **UNIT** 1 is the default **GLOBAL
   UNIT**. If there is no **GLOBAL UNIT** specified and **UNIT** 1 is
   absent from the geometry description, an error message is printed. If
   the geometry description contains an **ARRAY**, KENO V.a defaults the
   global array to the array referenced by the last **ARRAY**
   *PLACEMENT_DESCRIPTION* that is not immediately preceded by a unit
   description. Otherwise, it is the largest array number specified in
   the array data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`).

Examples of initiating a **UNIT**:

1. Initiate input data for **UNIT** No. 6.

..

   **UNIT** 6

2. Initiate input data for the **GLOBAL UNIT** which is **UNIT** No. 4.

..

   **GLOBAL UNIT** 4

For each **UNIT**, the **UNIT**\ ’s *DESCRIPTION* follows the
**UNIT**\ ’s *INITIALIZATION*. The *DESCRIPTION* is realized by
combining the commands listed below. The basic principles for
constructing a **UNIT** are different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. A
brief discussion of these principles, together with a few examples, is
presented at the end of this section following the description of the
basic input used to build the geometry of a **UNIT**. The keywords that
may be used to define a **UNIT** in KENO are as follows:

**shape**

**COM=**

**HOLE**

**ARRAY**

**REPLICATE** (KENO V.a only)

**REFLECTOR** (KENO V.a only)

**MEDIA** (KENO-VI only)

**BOUNDARY** (KENO-VI only)

Shape
.....

**Shape** is a generic keyword used to describe a basic geometric shape
that may be used in building the geometry of a particular **UNIT**. The
general format varies between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, the
**shape** defines a region containing a material, so the user is
required to provide both a material and a *bias ID*. In KENO-VI the
**shape** is used strictly as a surface, which is later used to define
the mono-material regions (using the **MEDIA** card). The user is
therefore required to enter a label for this surface so that the
**shape** can be referenced later.

KENO V.a:

**shape** *m* *b* *d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` [*a*\ :sub:`1` …* [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

KENO-VI:

**shape** *l* *d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` [*a*\ :sub:`1` …* [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

**shape** is a generic keyword that describes a basic predefined KENO
shape (e.g., **CUBOID**, **CYLINDER**) that is used to build the
geometry of the **UNIT**. The predefined shapes differ between KENO V.a
and KENO-VI. See Appendix A for a description of the KENO V.a basic
shapes and Appendix B for the KENO-VI shapes.

*m* is the mixture number of the material (positive integer) that fills
the particular shape in KENO V.a **UNIT** description. A material number
of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present in the
volume defined by the **shape**).

*b* is the bias identification number (*bias ID*, a positive integer)
assigned to the particular region defined by the **shape** in the KENO
V.a **UNIT** description.

*l* is the label (positive integer) assigned to the particular **shape**
in the KENO-VI **UNIT** description. This label is used later to define
a certain mono-material region within the **UNIT**.

*d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` represent the *N* dimensions (floating point numbers) that
define the particular **shape** (e.g., radius of a sphere or cylinder).
See Appendixes A and B for the particular value of *N* and how each
**shape** is described.

*a*\ :sub:`1` … *a*\ :sub:`M` are *M* optional *ATTRIBUTES* for the **shape**. The
attributes provide additional flexibility in the **shape** description.
The attributes that may be used with either KENO V.a or KENO-VI are
described below (see shape ATTRIBUTES).

shape ATTRIBUTES

The *ATTRIBUTES* that can be used to enhance the **shape** description
are **CHORD**, **ORIG**\ [**IN**], **CENTER**, and **ROTATE** (KENO-VI
only).

The CHORD attribute

This attribute has different formats in KENO V.a and KENO-VI. The user
will notice that it is more restrictive in KENO V.a. Only the
**HEMISPHERE and HEMICYLINDER shape**\ s can be **CHORD**\ ed in KENO
V.a, but all 3-D shapes may be **CHORD**\ ed in KENO-VI.

KENO V.a:
**CHORD** *ρ*

KENO-VI:
**CHORD** [**+X**\ =\ *x\ +*] [-**X**\ =\ *x\ -*] [**+Y**\ =\ *y\ +*]
[-**Y**\ =\ *y\ -*] [**+Z**\ =\ *z\ +*] [-**Z**\ =\ *z\ -*]

:math:`p`
  is the distance *ρ* from the cut surface to the center of the sphere
  or the axis of a hemicylinder. See :numref:`fig8-1-7` and :numref:`fig8-1-8`. Negative
  values of *ρ* indicate that less than half of the **shape** is retained,
  while positive values indicate that more than half of the **shape** will
  be retained.

**+X=**, -**X=**, **+Y=**, -**Y=**, **+Z=**, -**Z=**
  are subordinate
  keywords that define the axis parallel to the chord. The “+” and “-”
  signs are used to define the side of the chord which is included in the
  volume. A “+” in the keyword indicates that the more positive side of
  the chord is included in the volume. A “-” in the keyword indicates that
  the more negative side of the chord is included in the volume.

*x\ +, x\ -, y\ +, y\ -, z\ +, z\ -*
  are the coordinates of the plane
  perpendicular to the chord. For each chord added to a body, the keyword
  **CHORD** must be used, followed by one of the subordinate keywords and
  its dimension.

In KENO V.a, the CHORD attribute is applicable for only hemispherical
and hemicylindrical shapes, *not* for SPHERE, XCYLINDER, YCYLINDER,
CYLINDER, ZCYLINDER, CUBE, or CUBOID.

KENO-VI.

  Examples of the CHORD option in KENO-VI.

The ORIG\ [IN] attribute

The format is slightly different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. Since the
entries in KENO-VI are key worded, the user has more flexibility in
choosing the order of these entries or in using default values. Only
non-zero values must be entered in KENO-VI, but all applicable values,
whether zero or non-zero, must be entered in KENO V.a.

KENO V.a:
**ORIG**\ [**IN**] *a b* [*c*]

KENO-VI:
**ORIGIN** [**X**\ =\ *x*\ :sub:`0`] [**Y**\ =\ *y*\ :sub:`0`] [**Z**\ =\ *z*\ :sub:`0`]

:math:`a`
  is the X coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; the X
  coordinate of the centerline of a Z or Y cylinder or hemicylinder; the Y
  coordinate of the centerline of an X cylinder or hemicylinder.

:math:`b`
  is the Y coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; the Y
  coordinate of the centerline of a Z cylinder or hemicylinder; the Z
  coordinate of the centerline of an X or Y cylinder or hemicylinder.

:math:`c`
  is the Z coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; it must
  be omitted for all cylinders or hemicylinders.

**X=**, **Y=**, **Z=**
  are the subordinate keywords used to define the
  new position of the origin of the **shape**. If the a subordinate
  keyword appears more than once after the **ORIGIN** keyword, the values
  are summed. If the new value is zero, the particular coordinate does not
  need to be specified.

*x*\ :sub:`0`, *y*\ :sub:`0`, *z*\ :sub:`0`
  are the values for the new coordinates where the
  origin of the **shape** is to be translated.

The CENTER attribute

This attribute establishes the reference center for the flux moment
calculations, which can be useful in TSUNAMI calculations. The syntax
for this attribute is:

**CENTER** *center_type* [*u*] [*x y z*]

*center_type*
  is the reference center value, as described in
  :numref:`tab8-1-16`. The default value is **global**.

*u*
  is the **UNIT** number to be used as a reference center for this
  region when the *center_type* is **unit**.

*x*, *y*, *z*
  are the offset from the point specified by the
  *center_type*. The default is 0.0 for all three entries.

  +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+


The ROTATE attribute

This attribute can only be used in the KENO-VI input. It allows for the
rotation of the **shape** or **HOLE** to which it is applied. If
**ORIGIN** and **ROTATE** data follow the same **shape** or **HOLE**
record, the **shape** is always rotated prior to translation, regardless
of the order in which the data appear. Fig. 8.1.10 provides an example
of the use of the **ROTATE** option. Its syntax is:

**ROTATE** [**A1**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`1`] [**A2**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`2`] [**A3**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`3`]

**A1**\ =, **A2**\ =, **A3**\ =
  are subordinate keywords to specify the
  angles of rotation of the particular shape with respect to the origin of
  the coordinate system. The Euler X-convention is used for rotation.

*a*\ :sub:`1`, *a*\ :sub:`2`*, *a*\ :sub:`3`
  are the values of the Euler rotation angles in
  degrees. The default is 0 degrees. If a subordinate keyword appears more
  than once following the ROTATE keyword, the values are summed.

.. _fig8-1-10:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig10.png
  :align: center
  :width: 500

  Explanation of the ROTATE option.

Examples of **shape**\ s:

1. Specify a hemisphere labeled 10, containing material 2 with a radius
   of 5.0 cm which contains only material where Z > 2.0 within the
   sphere centered at the origin, and its origin translated to X=1.0,
   Y=1.5, and Z=3.0.
   KENO V.a (no label, but material and bias ID are the first two numerical entries):

   **HEMISPHERE** 2 1 5.0 **CHORD** -2.0 **ORIGIN** 1.0 1.5 3.0

   or

   **HEMISPHE+Z** 2 1 5.0 **CHORD** -2.0 **ORIGIN** 1.0 1.5 3.0

   KENO-VI (no material; this is to be specified with **MEDIA**):

   **SPHERE** 10 5.0 **CHORD** **+Z**\ =2.0 **ORIGIN** **X**\ =1.0
   **Y**\ =1.5 **Z**\ =3.0

2. Specify a hemicylinder labeled 10, containing material 1, having a
   radius of 5.0 cm and a length extending from Z=2.0 cm to Z=7.0 cm.
   The hemicylinder has been truncated perpendicular to the X axis at
   X= −3 such that material 1 does not exist between X= −3 and X= −5.
   Position the origin of the truncated hemicylinder at X=10 cm and
   Y=15 cm with respect to the origin of the unit, and rotate it (in
   KENO-VI input) so it is in the YZ plane at X=10 and at a 45° angle
   with the Y plane.

   KENO V.a (no rotation possible, no label):

   **ZHEMICYL+X** 1 1 5.0 7.0 2.0 **CHORD** 3.0 **ORIGIN** 10.0 15.0

   KENO-VI (no material; this is to be specified with **MEDIA** card):

   **CYLINDER** 10 5.0 7.0 2.0 **CHORD** **+X**\ = −3.0 **ORIGIN**
   **X**\ =10.0 **Y**\ =15.0 **ROTATE** **A2**\ = −45

COM=
....

The keyword **COM**\ = signals that a comment is to be read. The
optional comment can be placed anywhere within a unit definition. Its
syntax is:

**COM** = *delim comment delim*

*delim*
  is the delimiter, which may be any one of “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !

*comment*
  is the comment string, up to 132 characters long.

Example of comment within a **UNIT**:

**COM**\ =“This is a fuel pin”

HOLE
....

This entry is used to position a **UNIT** within a surrounding **UNIT**
relative to the origin of the surrounding **UNIT**. **HOLE**\ s may
share surfaces with but may not intersect other **HOLE**\ s, the
**BOUNDARY** of the **UNIT** which contains the **HOLE**, or an
**ARRAY** boundary. In KENO-VI, the **BOUNDARY** record of a **UNIT**
placed in a **HOLE** may contain more than one geometry label, but all
labels must be positive, indicating inside the respective geometry
bodies. The syntax for **HOLE** is:

KENO V.a:
**HOLE** *u x y z*

KENO-VI:
**HOLE** *u* [*a*\ :sub:`1` … [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

*u*
  is the unit previously defined that is to be placed within the
  **HOLE**.

*x y z*
  is the position of the **HOLE** in the KENO V.a host **UNIT**.

*a\ 1 … a\ M*
  are optional KENO-VI *ATTRIBUTES* for the **HOLE**. The
  *ATTRIBUTES* can be **ORIGIN** or **ROTATE** and follow the same syntax
  previously defined for KENO-VI **shape** *ATTRIBUTES*. These
  *ATTRIBUTES* allow for the translation and/or rotation of the **HOLE**
  within the host region.

Examples of **HOLE** use:

Place **UNIT** 2 in the surrounding **UNIT** such that the **ORIGIN** of
**UNIT** 2 is at **X**\ =3, **Y**\ =3.5, **Z**\ =4 relative to the
origin of the surrounding **UNIT**.

KENO V.a:
**HOLE** 2 3 3.5 4

KENO-VI:
**HOLE** 2 **ORIGIN** **X**\ =3.0 **Y**\ =3.5 **Z**\ =4.0

ARRAY
.....

When used within a **UNIT** description, this entry provides an
**ARRAY** placement description. In KENO V.a, it always starts a new
**UNIT** and generates a rectangular parallelepiped that fits the outer
boundaries of the specified **ARRAY**. The specified **ARRAY** is
positioned in the **UNIT** according to the most negative point in the
**ARRAY** with respect to the coordinate system of the surrounding
**UNIT**. Thus, the location of the minimum x, minimum y, and minimum z
point in the array is specified in the coordinate system of the **UNIT**
into which the **ARRAY** is being placed.

In KENO-VI, the **ARRAY** keyword is used to position an **ARRAY**
within a region in a surrounding **UNIT** relative to the origin of the
surrounding **UNIT**. When the subordinate keyword **PLACE** is entered,
it is followed by six numbers that precisely locate the **ARRAY** within
the surrounding **UNIT** as shown in the example below. The first three
numbers consist of the element in the **ARRAY** of the **UNIT** selected
to position the **ARRAY**. The next three numbers consist of the
position of the origin of the selected **UNIT** in the surrounding
**UNIT**. Higher level **ARRAY** boundaries may intersect lower level
**ARRAY** boundaries as long as they do not intersect **HOLE**\ s in the
**UNIT**\ s contained in the **ARRAY** or in **UNIT**\ s contained in
lower level **ARRAY**\ s.

The syntax for the **ARRAY** card is as follows:

KENO V.a:
**ARRAY** *array_id* *x y z*

KENO-VI:
**ARRAY** *array_id* *l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N` [**PLACE** *N*\ :sub:`x` *N*\ :sub:`y` *N*\ :sub:`z` *x y
z*]

*array_id*
  is the label that identifies the array to be placed.

*l\ 1* … *l\ N*
  is the *REGION DEFINITION VECTOR*. These are previously
  defined **shape** labels, and together they define the region in which
  the array *array_id* is to be placed. This is used only in KENO-VI.

*N\ x N\ y N\ z*
  are three integers that define the element in the
  **ARRAY** of the **UNIT** selected to position the **ARRAY**. This is
  used only in KENO-VI.

*x y z*
  specify the position of the **ARRAY** in the **UNIT**.

  In KENO V.a, the x, y, and z values are the point where the most
  negative x, y, and z point of the **ARRAY** is to be located in the
  **UNIT**\ ’s coordinates.

  In KENO-VI, the x, y, and z values are the point where the origin of the
  **UNIT** specified by *N\ x*, *N\ y*, and *N\ z* is to be located in the
  **shape** specified by the *REGION DEFINITION VECTOR*.

Example of **ARRAY** use:

In KENO V.a, position the most negative point of **ARRAY** 6 at X = 2.0,
Y = 3.0, Z = 4.0 relative to the origin of the containing **UNIT**.

**ARRAY** 6 2.0 3.0 4.0

In KENO-VI, position instead the origin of **UNIT** (1,2,3) of **ARRAY**
6 at X = 2.0, Y = 3.0, Z = 4.0 and specify the **ARRAY** boundary to be
the region that is inside the geometry **shape**\ s labeled 10 and 20
and outside the geometry **shape** labeled 30 used to describe the
surrounding **UNIT**.

**ARRAY** 6 10 20 −30 **PLACE** 1 2 3 2.0 3.0 4.0

REPLICATE and REFLECTOR
.......................


These keywords specific to KENO V.a are used to generate additional
geometry regions having the **shape** of the previous region. The
geometry keyword **REFLECTOR** is a synonym for **REPLICATE**. The
desired weighting functions can be applied to those regions by
specifying biasing data as described in :ref:`8-1-2-7`. The total
thickness generated for each surface is the thickness per region for
that surface times the number of regions to be generated, *nreg*.

The replicate specification is frequently used to generate weighting
regions external to an **ARRAY** placement description. Thus an
**ARRAY** placement description followed by a **REPLICATE** description
would generate regions of a cuboidal shape. A cylindrical reflector
could be generated by following the **ARRAY** placement description with
a **CYLINDER** and then a **REPLICATE**. A **HOLE** cannot immediately
follow a **REPLICATE**.

Extra regions using default weights can be generated by specifying the
first importance region, *imp*, to be one that was not defined in the
*BIASING INFORMATION* provided in a **READ BIAS** block. This capability
can be used to generate extra regions for collecting information such as
fluxes, leakage, etc.

Multiple replicate descriptions can be used in any problem. This
capability can be used to model different reflector materials of
different thicknesses on different faces.

The number of appropriate region dimensions needed for specifying
**REPLICATE** is determined by the preceding region. For example, if the
previous region were a **SPHERE**, one entry (i.e., *t*\ :sub:`1`) would be
required. If the previous region were a **CYLINDER**, the first entry,
*t*\ :sub:`1`, would be the thickness/region in the radial direction, the
second entry, *t*\ :sub:`2`, would the thickness/region in the positive length
direction, the third entry, *t*\ :sub:`3`, would be the thickness/region in the
negative length direction, etc. The **REPLICATE** specification
requirements for a **CUBE** are the same as for a **CUBOID**.

Syntax:

**REPLICATE|REFLECTOR** *m* *b* *t*\ :sub:`1` … *t*\ :sub:`N` *nreg*

*m*
  is the number of the material (non-negative integer) that fills the
  particular REPLICATE/REFLECTOR region in the **UNIT** description. A
  material of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present
  in the volume defined by the **shape**).

*b*
  is the bias identification number (positive integer) assigned to the
  particular region defined by the **shape** in the KENO V.a **UNIT**
  description. If the specified bias ID is defined in a **READ BIAS**
  block, the bias ID number will be incremented automatically, increasing
  one for each additional region up to *nreg*.

*t*\ :sub:`1` … *t*\ :sub:`N`
  represent the thickness (floating point number) per region
  for each of the *N* surfaces that define the particular **shape**. If
  the specified bias ID is one that is defined in the READ BIAS block, the
  region thicknesses should be consistent with the thicknesses used to
  generate the bias data being used. See :ref:`9-1-2-7`.

*nreg*
  is the number of regions (integer) to be generated.

Example:

Create five regions of material 4, each being 3 cm thick, outside a
cuboid region (a cuboid has six dimensions). The inner-most of the five
generated regions has a *bias id* of 2. The following four regions have
*bias id* of 3, 4, 5, and 6.

MEDIA
.....

This card is used in the KENO-VI input file to define the location of a
mixture relative to the geometric **shape**\ s in the **UNIT**.
:numref:`fig8-1-11` shows the input for a set of three intersecting
**SPHERE**\ s in a **CUBOID**. The total volume data for a region in the
problem may be entered as the last entry on the **MEDIA** card by using
the keyword “\ **VOL**\ =” keyword immediately followed by the volume in
cm\ :sup:`3`. The volume entered is the volume of the region in the unit
multiplied by the number of times the unit occurs in the problem minus
any volume excluded from the problem by **ARRAY** boundaries and
**HOLE**\ s. The volumes for any or all regions may be entered. If the
volume is entered here, this value will be used even if volumes are also
entered as a file or calculated (See :ref:`8-1-2-13`). Volumes not
entered will be determined by the input specified in the VOLUME DATA
block. If no volume is supplied, the KENO-VI default volume of -1 will
be used. This only affects volume-averaged quantities, i.e., not
*k*\ :sub:`eff`.

Syntax:

**MEDIA** *m* *b* *l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N` [**VOL**\ =\ *v*]

*m*
  is the material (positive integer or zero for vacuum) that fills the
  region defined by **MEDIA**.

*b*
  is the *bias id* for the material sector being defined.

*l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N`
  is the region definition vector (*N* integers). These
  are *N* previously defined **shape** labels that together define the
  material sector.

**VOL**\ =
  is an optional sub-keyword used to input the material sector
  volume.

*v*
  is the volume in cm\ :sup:`3` of the material sector defined by the
  **MEDIA** card.

BOUNDARY
........

This card is used in KENO-VI to define the outer boundary of the
**UNIT**. In KENO V.a, the outer boundary of the **UNIT** is implicitly
defined by the last **shape** in the **UNIT**. Each **UNIT** must have
one and only one **BOUNDARY** card.

Syntax:

**BOUNDARY** *l\ 1* … *l\ N*

*l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N`
  is the **UNIT** *BOUNDARY DEFINITION VECTOR* (*N*
  integers). These are *N* previously defined **shape** labels that
  together define the outer boundary of the **UNIT**. All entries must be
  positive for the **UNIT** being defined to be used subsequently as a
  **HOLE**.

ARRAY Data
~~~~~~~~~~

The array definition data block is used to define the size of an
**ARRAY** and to position **UNIT**\ s (defined in the geometry data) in
a 3-D lattice that represents the **ARRAY** being described. As many
arrays as are necessary can be described in a problem, subject to
computer storage limitations. In KENO V.a, only one **ARRAY** may be
placed directly in a **UNIT**, but as many **ARRAY**\ s as are needed
may be placed in the **UNIT** by using **HOLE**\ s. In KENO-VI,
any number of arrays can be placed in any **UNIT** either directly or
indirectly using **HOLE**\ s. There is no default global array. If a
global array is desired it must be explicitly defined.

The **ARRAY** definition data is entered as:

READ ARRAY ARRAY_ DATA END ARRAY

The *ARRAY\_ DATA* consists of *ARRAY_PARAMETERS* and
*UNIT_ORIENTATION_DESCRIPTION*.

.. _8-1-2-5-1:

ARRAY Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ARRAY parameters that can be used in the definition of an ARRAY are:

**ARA**\ =

**GBL**\ =

**NUX**\ =, **NUY**\ =, **NUZ**\ =

**PRT**\ =

**COM**\ =

**TYP**\ = (KENO-VI only)

ARA=
....

The **ARA**\ = parameter defines a reference number for an **ARRAY**. It
has no default in KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, if is missing, the default is 1.

Syntax:

**ARA**\ =\ *a*

*a*
  is the reference number for the **ARRAY**. It has no default in
  KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, if is missing, the default is 1.

GBL=
....

This is used to input the number of the global array.

Syntax:

**GBL**\ =\ *g*

*g*
  is the reference number for the global **ARRAY**. In KENO V.a it
  must not be entered more than once. The default is the largest value for
  *a*, the reference number for the **ARRAY**. In KENO-VI it is no default
  value and if entered more than once, the last value is used.

PRT=
....

This entry is used to enable printing the **ARRAY** of **UNIT** numbers.

Syntax:

**PRT**\ =\ *print*

*print*
  is a logical constant which defaults to YES, indicating that the
  **ARRAY** of **UNIT** numbers is printed. If the value is NO, then a
  summary table is printed instead containing the number of times each
  unit is used in each array.

.. _8-1-2-5-1-4:

NUX=, NUY=, NUZ=
................


These entries are used to input the number of units in the X, Y, and Z
directions, respectively.

Syntax:

**NUX**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`x` **NUY**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`y` **NUZ**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`z`

*n*\ :sub:`x` *n*\ :sub:`y` *n*\ :sub:`z`
  are the number of units in the X, Y, and Z directions,
  respectively. There is no default in KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, each of them
  defaults to 1.

TYPE=
.....

This entry is used to specify the type of **ARRAY** and is specific to
KENO-VI, where more than one type of arrays can be used. It cannot be
used in KENO V.a.

Syntax:

**TYP**\ =\ *atyp*

*atyp*
  type of array (**cuboidal** or **square**, **hexagonal** or
  **triangular**, **rhexagonal**, **shexagonal**, **dodecahedral**),
  default = **cuboidal**

.. _8-1-2-5-1-6:

COM=
....

This keyword is used to enter a comment.

Syntax:

**COM**\ =\ *delim comment delim*

*delim*
  is a delimiter. Acceptable delimiters are “, ‘, \* , ^ , or !.

*comment*
  is the comment string. Maximum *comment* length is
  132 characters.

.. _8-1-2-5-2:

ARRAY orientation data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two methods to enter the **UNIT** numbers constituting an
**ARRAY**: **LOOP** and **FILL**.

LOOP Construct
..............

The **LOOP** construct resembles a FORTRAN DO-loop construct.
The arrangement of **UNIT**\ s may be considered as consisting of a 3-D
matrix of **UNIT** numbers, with the **UNIT** position increasing in the
positive X, Y, and Z directions, respectively.

Syntax:

**LOOP** *u* *ix*\ :sub:`1` *ix*\ :sub:`2` incx *iy*\ :sub:`1` *iy*\ :sub:`2` incy *iz*\ :sub:`1` *iz*\ :sub:`2` *incz* **END
LOOP**

*u*
  is the **UNIT** identification number (a positive integer).

*ix*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the X direction; *ix*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`x` of :ref:`8-1-2-5-1-4`.

*ix*\ :sub:`2` is the ending position in the X direction; *ix*\ :sub:`2` must be at
least 1 and less than or equal to *n\ x*.

*incx*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive X direction; *incx* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub:`x`.

*iy*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the Y direction; *iy*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`y`.

*iy*\ :sub:`2`
  is the ending position in the Y direction; *iy*\ :sub:`2` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`y`.

*incy*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive Y direction; *incy* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub`y`.

*iz*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the Z direction; *iz*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

*iz*\ :sub:`2`
  is the ending position in the Z direction;, *iz*\ :sub:`2` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

*incz*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive Z direction; *incz* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

The syntax for ending the **LOOP** construct is:

**END LOOP**

The sequence *u* through *incz* is repeated until the entire **ARRAY**
is described. If any portion of an **ARRAY** is defined in a conflicting
manner, the last entry to define that portion will determine the
**ARRAY**\ ’s configuration. To use this feature, fill the entire
**ARRAY** with the most relevant **UNIT** number and superimpose the
other **UNIT** numbers in their proper places. An example showing the
use of the **LOOP** option is given below. This 5 × 4 × 3 **ARRAY** of
**UNIT**\ s is a matrix of **UNIT**\ s that has 5 \ **UNIT**\ s stacked
in the X direction, 4 \ **UNIT**\ s in the Y direction, and
3 \ **UNIT**\ s in the Z direction. X increases from left to right, and
Y increases from bottom to top. Each Z layer is shown separately.

.. highlight:: scale

Given:

::

		1 2 1 2 1	  2 1 2 1 2	  1 1 1 1 1
		1 1 1 1 1	  2 2 2 2 2	  1 3 3 3 1
		1 1 1 1 1	  2 2 2 2 2	  1 3 3 3 1
		1 2 1 2 1	  2 1 2 1 2	  1 1 1 1 1
		Z Layer 1	  Z Layer 2	  Z Layer 3

The data for this array could be entered using the following entries.

(1)  1  1 5 1  1 4 1  1 3 1
This fills the entire array with 1s.

(2)  2  2 5 2  1 4 3  1 1 1
This loads the four 2s in the first Z layer.

(3)  2  1 5 1  2 3 1  2 2 1
This loads the second and third rows of 2s in the second Z layer.

(4)  2  1 5 2  1 4 3  2 2 1
This loads the desired 2s in the first and fourth rows of the second Z layer.

(5)  3  2 4 1  2 3 1  3 3 1
This loads the 3s in the third Z layer and completes the array data input.

The second layer could have been defined by substituting the following data for entries (3) and (4):

(3)  2  1 5 1  1 4 1  2 2 1
This completely fills the second layer with 2s.

(4)  1  2 4 2  1 4 3  2 2 1
This loads the four 1s in the second layer.

When using the **LOOP** option, there is no single correct method of
entering the data. If a **UNIT** is improperly positioned in the
**ARRAY** or if some positions in the **ARRAY** are left undefined, it
is often easier to add data to correctly define the **ARRAY** than to
try to correct the existing data.

FILL Construct
..............

The **FILL** construct enters data by stringing in **UNIT** numbers
starting at X=1, Y=1, Z=1, and varying X, then Y, and then Z to fill the
**ARRAY**. *n*\ :sub:`x` x *n*\ :sub:`y` x *n*\ :sub:`z` entries are required. FIDO-like
input options specified in :numref:`tab8-1-17` are also available for filling
the **ARRAY**.

Syntax:

**FILL** *u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`N` {**END FILL}**\ \|\ **T**

*u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`N` are the *N*\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`x` x *n*\ :sub:`y` x *n*\ :sub:`z` **UNIT** numbers
that make up the **ARRAY**

The syntax for ending the **FILL** construct is

**END FILL**

An alternative to end the **UNIT** data in **FILL** is by entering the
letter **T**.

.. note:: When entering data using the options in this table, the *count
   field* and *option field* must be adjacent with no imbedded blanks.
   The operand field may be separated from the option field by one or
   more blanks.

Example: Consider a 3 × 3 × 1 **ARRAY** filled with 8 **UNIT** 1s and a
**UNIT** 2, as shown below.

::


  1	1	1
  1	2	1
  1	1	1

The input data to describe this **ARRAY** could be entered as follows:

(1) 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 **T**
  This fills the array one position at a time,
  starting at the lower left corner. The \ **T** terminates the data.

or

(2) F1 A5 2 **END FILL**
  The F1 fills the entire array with 1s, the A5
  locates the fifth position in the array, and the 2 loads a 2 in that
  position. The **END FILL** terminates the data.

Albedo data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Albedo boundary conditions are entered by assigning an albedo condition
to each face of the outermost boundary. The **default value for each
face is vacuum**. The default values are overridden only on faces for
which other albedo names are specified. Albedo boundary conditions are
applied **only** to **the outermost region of a problem.** In KENO V.a
this geometry region must be a rectangular parallelepiped. The outer
boundary can be any **shape** (or combination of **shape**\ s) in
KENO-VI. Material-specific albedos (e.g., H2O and CONC) may not be used
in continuous energy calculations.

KENO-VI users need to be aware that when a neutron reaches a surface
with a vacuum albedo, that neutron is lost. If a model contains features
that are reentrant, that is a neutron could exit the model and reenter
the model on the other side of an unmodeled region, all neutrons passing
through the problem boundary are lost when they reach the unmodeled
region. Neutrons are not “transported” across unmodeled areas between
reentrant surfaces. It is not possible to create a KENO V.a model with
reentrant problem outer boundary surfaces.

The syntax for entering the albedo boundary conditions is:

**READ BOUNDS** **fc**\ :sub:`1`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`1` [**fc**\ :sub:`2`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`2`\ …
[**fc**\ :sub:`N`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`N` ]…] **END BOUNDS**

**fc**\ :sub:`1` … **fc**\ :sub:`N` are **N** face codes as defined in :numref:`tab8-1-18`.

*a*\ :sub:`1` … *a*\ :sub:`N` are the albedo types as defined in :numref:`tab8-1-19`

:numref:`tab8-1-19` lists some material-specific albedo sets. Care must be
exercised when using material-specific albedo types. These data sets
were generated using a real problem, and they implicitly reflect the
neutron energy spectrum, materials, and geometry from that model. Where
neutron energy spectra, materials, and geometry vary from that model,
the material-specific albedos may give significantly incorrect results.
This may be checked by comparing results from a sample of calculations
performed with both explicitly modeled reflectors and material-specific
albedos. In general, use of material-specific albedos is not
recommended.

The **BODY** and **SURFACE** keywords are unique to KENO-VI. The face
code **BODY**\ = refers to the body label in global unit input. For
example, assume the **GLOBAL UNIT** boundary record in a KENO-VI input
consisted of the following: **BOUNDARY** 10 −30 20. In this case
**BODY**\ =10 would refer to the geometry record labeled 10,
**BODY**\ =20 would refer to the geometry record labeled 20, and
**BODY**\ =30 would refer to the geometry record labeled 30. All surface
numbers following the **BODY** keyword apply to that body. The default
value of **BODY** is the first geometry label listed in the **GLOBAL
UNIT** boundary record.

All the face codes, listed in the first part of :numref:`tab8-1-18`, except
**BODY**\ = and **SURFACE**\ (ii)= were intended to apply only to
cuboids (KENO V.a). However, when used with non-cuboidal surfaces
(KENO-VI) they will fill in the first six surface positions of a body in
the following order, +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z. The **ALL** face code will
apply the listed boundary conditions to all surfaces of the body
currently being considered.

Albedo boundary conditions may be entered on each **GLOBAL UNIT**
boundary surface multiple times. The boundary condition that applies to
the surface is the last one entered. If no boundary data are entered or
if no albedo boundary condition is applied to a **GLOBAL UNIT** boundary
surface, then the boundary surface is assumed to have a void or vacuum
boundary condition. Any **CHORD**\ ed surfaces that are **GLOBAL UNIT**
boundaries will use the default (void) boundary condition, and it cannot
be changed. This restriction may need to be considered when building the
geometry of the **GLOBAL UNIT**.

Example:
  Use a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face
  of a problem with a cuboidal boundary and use mirror image reflection on
  the +X and −X faces of the cuboid to represent an infinite linear array
  on a 2 ft. thick concrete pad.

  **READ BOUNDS** **−ZB**\ =CON24 **XFC**\ =MIRROR **END BOUNDS**

Example:
  Use a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face
  of a problem with a hexagonal boundary, and use mirror image reflection
  on all side faces of the hexprism to represent an infinite planar array
  on a 2 ft. thick concrete pad.

  **READ BOUNDS**

  **SURFACE**\ (1)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (2)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (3)=MIRROR

  **SURFACE**\ (4)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (5)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (6)=MIRROR

  **SURFACE**\ (7)=VACUUM **SURFACE**\ (8)=CONC24

  **END BOUNDS**

Example:
  The outer boundary of the global unit consists of a cuboid
  (body label 10) and a sphere (body label 20). The sphere is large enough
  to cut the corners of the cuboid leaving most of the cuboid intact. Use
  a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face of the cuboid
  to represent a 2 ft. thick concrete pad. Use the DP0H2O on the other
  surfaces to represent an infinite water reflector.

  **READ BOUNDS**

  **BODY**\ =10 **ALL**\ =DP0H2O **−ZB**\ =CON24

  **BODY**\ =20 **SURFACE**\ (1)=DP0H2O

  **END BOUNDS**

.. WARNING:: The user should thoroughly understand material-specific
  albedos (e.g., DP0H2O, CON24, etc.) before attempting to use these
  reflectors. Missapplication of these problem-specific albedo data can
  cause the code to produce incorrect results without obvious symptoms.**

Biasing or weighting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The biasing data block is used (in only multigroup mode) to define the
weight that is given to a neutron surviving Russian roulette. The
average weight of a neutron that survives Russian roulette, *wtavg*, is
defaulted to *dwtav* (**WTA**\ = in the parameter data [see :ref:`8-1-2-3`])
for all *BIAS IDs* and can be overridden by entering biasing
information.

The *biasing_information* is used to relate a *BIAS ID* to the desired
energy-dependent values of *wtavg*. This concept is similar to the way
the *MIXTURE ID, mat*, is related to the macroscopic cross section data.

The weighting functions used in KENO  are energy-dependent values of
*wtavg* that are applicable over a given thickness interval of a
material. For example, the weighting function for water is composed of
sets of energy-dependent values of *wtavg* for 11 intervals, each
interval being 3 cm thick. The first set of *wtavg’s* is for the 0–3 cm
interval of water, the second set of *wtavg’s* is for the 3–6 cm
interval of water, etc. The eleventh set of *wtavg’s* is for the 30–33
cm interval of water.

To input biasing information, a *BIAS ID* must be assigned to correspond
to a set of *wtavg*. Biasing data can specify a *MATERIAL ID* from the
existing KENO V.a weighting library or from the *AUXILIARY DATA* input.
The materials available from the KENO  weighting library are listed in
:numref:`tab8-1-20`.

The *biasing_information* is entered in one of the following two forms.
The first set is said to input the *CORRELATION DATA*, while the second
form is said to input the *AUXILIARY DATA*.

**READ BIAS ID**\ =\ *m ib ie* **END BIAS**

or

**READ BIAS WT**\ [**S**]=\ *wttitl id s* *t*\ :sub:`1` *i*\ :sub:`1` *g*\ :sub:`1` *w*\ :sub:`1,1` …
*w*\ :sub:`1,i1xg1` … *t*\ :sub:`s` *i*\ :sub:`s` *g*\ :sub:`s` *w*\ :sub:`s,1` … *w*\ :sub:`s,isxgs`   **END BIAS**

**ID=** specifies that *CORRELATION DATA* will be entered next.

**WT=** or **WTS=** specifies that *AUXILIARY DATA* will be entered
next.

*m*
  is the identification (material ID) for the material whose weighting
  function is to be used. A material ID can be chosen from the existing
  KENO weighting library (:numref:`tab8-1-20`) or from the *auxiliary data* input
  using the second form of the **BIAS** block as described later. If a
  material ID appears in both the KENO weighting library and the
  *auxiliary data*, the *weights* from the *auxiliary data* will be used.

*ib*
  is the bias ID of the weighting function for the first interval of
  material *m*. The geometry record having the bias ID equal to *ib* will
  use the group-dependent *weights* from the first interval of material
  *m*.

*ie*
  is the bias ID of the group-dependent *weights* from the (*ie* −
  *ib* + 1)\ *th* interval of material *m*.

*wttitl*
  is an arbitrary title name (12 characters maximum), such as
  CONCRETE, WATER, SPECIALH2O, etc., to identify the material for which
  the user is entering data. Embedded blanks are not allowed.

*id*
  is an identification number (material ID). The value is arbitrary.
  However, if the data are to be utilized in the problem, this ID must
  also be used at least once in the first form of the **BIAS** block.

*s*
  is the number of sets of group structures for which *weights* will
  be read for this ID.

*t*\ :sub:`1`\ … *t*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* thicknesses of each increment for which *weights*
  will be read for this ID.

*i*\ :sub:`1`\ … *i*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* numbers of increments for which *weights* will be
  read for this ID.

*g*\ :sub:`1`\ … *g*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* numbers of energy groups for which *weights* will
  be read.

*w*\ :sub:`1,i1xg1`\ … *w*\ :sub:`s,isxgs`
  are *s* sets of *weights*, each set containing
  a number of *weights* equal to the product of number of increments times
  the number of groups for that set. The group index varies the fastest.

.. Warning:: The user should thoroughly understand weighted tracking
  before attempting to generate and use auxiliary data for biasing. Incorrect
  weighting can cause the code to produce incorrect results without obvious symptoms.

.. caution:: 1. Each set of *AUXILIARY* or *CORRELATION* data must be completely
  described in conjunction with its keyword. Complete sets of these data
  can be interspersed in an arbitrary order but data within each set must
  be entered in the specified order.

  2. *AUXILIARY DATA*: If the same *m* is specified in more than one set
  of data, the last set having the group structure used in the problem is
  the set that will be utilized. When *AUXILIARY DATA* are entered,
  *CORRELATION DATA* must also be entered in order to use the *AUXILIARY
  DATA*.

  3. *CORRELATION DATA*: If biasing data define the same bias ID (from the
  geometry data) more than once, the value that is entered last supersedes
  previous entries. *Be well aware that multiple definitions for the same
  bias ID can cause erroneous answers due to overbiasing.*

  4. Bias data may not be used in continuous energy mode.

.. centered:: Examples

1. Use the first form of the **BIAS** block to utilize the water biasing
   factors in bias IDs 2 through 11. From :numref:`tab8-1-20`, water has
   material ID m=500 and has bias parameters for 10 intervals that are
   each 3 cm thick.

**READ BIAS ID**\ =500 2 11 **END BIAS**

2. Use the second form of the **BIAS** block to specify biasing factors
   for SPECIALWATER to be used in bias IDs 6 and 7. The SPECIALWATER
   biasing factors have a value of 0.69 for BIAS ID 6 and 0.86 for bias
   ID 7 in each energy group. Sixteen-group cross sections are being
   used. Each weighting region is 3.048 cm thick. The material ID is
   arbitrarily chosen to be 510. Note that the first form of the
   **BIAS** block must be entered to allow the second form of the
   **BIAS** block to be used for BIAS IDs 6 and 7.

**READ BIAS WT**\ =SPECIALWATER 510 1 3.048 2 16 16*0.69 16*0.86
**ID**\ =510 6 7 **END BIAS**

3. An example of multiple definitions for the same bias ID follows:

**READ BIAS ID**\ =400 2 7 **ID**\ =500 5 7 **END BIAS** .

The data for paraffin (**ID**\ =400) will be used for bias IDs 2, 3, and
4, and the data for water (**ID**\ =500) will be used for bias IDs 5, 6,
and 7. The paraffin data for bias IDs 5, 6, and 7 have been overwritten
by water data.

Multiple definitions for the same bias ID are not necessarily incorrect,
but the user should be cautious about using multiple definitions and
should ensure that the desired biasing or weighting functions are used
in the desired geometry regions.

4. An example of how the *bias ID* relates to the energy-dependent
   values of *weights* is given below.

Assume that a paraffin reflector is to be used, and it is desirable to
use the weighting function from the KENO weighting library to minimize
the running time for the problem. Also assume that these weighting
functions are to be used in the volumes defined in the geometry records
having the *bias ID* (defined on a **shape** or **MEDIA** card for KENO
V.a and KENO-VI, respectively) equal to 6, 7, 8, and 9. *Correlation
data* are then entered and *auxiliary data* will not be entered.

The biasing data would be:

**READ BIAS ID**\ =400 6 9 **END BIAS**.

The results of these data are

(1) the group-dependent *weights* for the 0–3 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 6.

(2) the group-dependent *weights* for the 3–6 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 7.

(3) the group-dependent *weights* for the 6–9 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 8.

(4) the group-dependent *weights* for the 9–12 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 9.

Start data
~~~~~~~~~~

Special start options are available for controlling the initial neutron
distribution. The default starting distribution for an array is flat
over the overall array dimensions, in fissile material only. The default
starting distribution for a single unit is flat over the system, in
fissile material only. See :numref:`tab8-1-21` for the starting distributions
available in KENO. The syntax for the **START** block is:

Extra 1-D XSECS IDs data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra 1-D cross section IDs are not required. They are allowed as input
in order to simplify future modifications to calculate reaction rates,
etc., as well as for compatibility with other SCALE codes. The syntax
for the extra 1-D cross section data block is:

**READ X1DS** **NEUTRON** *i\ 1 …i\ x1d* **END X1DS**

**NEUTRON**
  is a keyword to indicate that the following ID identifies a
  neutron interaction.

*i*\ :sub:`1` … *i*\ :sub:`x1d`
  **X1D** 1-D identification numbers or keyword identifiers
  for the 1-D cross section to be used. These cross sections must be
  available on the mixture cross section library. **X1D** entries are
  expected to be read (see integer PARAMETER data).

.. _8-1-2-10:

Mixing table data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A cross section mixing table must be entered if KENO is being run stand
alone and a Monte Carlo cross section format library is not being used
in the multigroup mode, or KENO is being run stand alone in the
continuous energy mode. If the parameter **LIB**\ = (Sect. 8.1.2.3) is
entered, then mixing table data must be entered. A cross section mixing
table is entered using the following syntax:

**READ MIXT** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END MIXT**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters that might or might not be keyworded.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **MIXT** block are
described below.

**SCT =** *nsct*
  is used to input the number of scattering angles and
  only applies in multigroup mode. *nsct* is the number of discrete
  scattering angles, default = 1. The number of scattering angles
  specifies the number of discrete scattering angles to be used for the
  cross sections. If SCT is not set (i.e., SCT= −1), then the number of
  scattering angles is determined from the cross section library
  specified. The number of scattering angles defaults to (ncoef+1)/2,
  where ncoef is the largest Legendre polynomial order used in the
  problem. It needs to be entered only once for a problem. If more than
  one value is entered, the last one is used for the problem. For
  assistance in determining the number of discrete scattering angles for
  the cross sections, see :ref:`8-1-3-4-3`.

**EPS =** *pbxs*
  is used to enter the cross section message cutoff
  value, and it only applies in multigroup mode. *pbxs* is the value of
  the P\ :sub:`0` cross section for each transfer, above which generated
  warning messages will be printed, default = 3 × 10\ :sup:`−5`. The
  primary purpose of entering this cutoff value is to suppress printing
  these messages when they are generated during cross section processing.
  For assistance in determining a value for EPS, see :ref:`8-1-3-4-4`.

**MIX =** *mix*
  is used to input the identification number of the
  mixture being described. *mix* defines the mixture being described.

**NCM** = *ncmx*
  is used to input the nuclide mixture IDs to be used for
  this mixture. *ncmx* defines the nuclide mixture ID. When
  **MIX**\ =\ *mix* is read, *ncmx* is defaulted to *mix* also. Then, as
  long as all the nuclides that need to be mixed into *mix* already have
  *mix* specified as their nuclide mixture (frequently the case when using
  SCALE), the user does not need to specify **NCM**. The most usual case
  where **NCM** must be specified is when the mixtures were specified as a
  different mixture number when they were created in SCALE as compared to
  the mixture number used for them in KENO. Cell homogenized mixtures also
  need **NCM** specified.

**TMP**\ \|\ **TEM** = *temperature*
  is used to input the desired
  temperature of the CE cross section data.

*nucl*
  is the nuclide ID number from the AMPX working format cross
  section library.

**XS**\ =\ *fname*
  is used to input the optional continuous energy cross
  section filename to override the default cross sections. *fname* is the
  name of the file.

*dens*
  is the number density (atoms/b-cm) associated with nuclide ID
  number *nucl*.

The sequence “\ *nucl* **NCM**\ =\ *ncmx* [**XS**\ =\ *fname*] *dens*\ ”
may be repeated until the mixture defined by **MIX**\ =\ *mix* has been
completely described.

The sequence “\ **MIX =** *mix* **NCM** = *ncmx* **TMP**\ \|\ **TEM** =
*temperature nucl* **NCM**\ =\ *ncmx* [**XS**\ =\ *fname*] *dens*\ ” may
be repeated until all the mixtures have been described.

.. note:: If a given nuclide ID is entered more than once in the same
   mixture, then the number densities for that nuclide are summed.

   If a mixture number is used as a nuclide ID, then it is treated as a
   nuclide and the number density associated with it is used as a
   density modifier. (If the density is entered as 1, then the mixture
   is mixed in at full density. If it is entered as 0.5, the mixture is
   mixed in at one half of its full density.) A Monte Carlo formatted
   cross section library is generated on the unit defined by the
   parameter **XSC=**. If this data set is saved, subsequent cases can
   utilize these mixtures without remixing.

   The entry **XS**\ =\ *fname* is optional. If a nuclide is entered
   more than once in a mixture and this entry is specified, then they
   must be the same (i.e., cannot use more than one continuous energy
   cross section sets for a nuclide in a given mixture). Different
   mixtures may have the same nuclide with different continuous energy
   cross section sets.

.. _8-1-2-11:

Plot data
~~~~~~~~~

Plots of slices specified through the geometry can be generated and
displayed (1) as character plots using alphanumeric characters to
represent mixture numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers or (2) as
color plots which generate a PNG file using colors to represent mixture
numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers. Color plots require an
independent program to display the PNG file to a PC or workstation
monitor or to convert the file to be displayed using a plotting device.
The keyword **SCR=** is used to control the plot display method.
**SCR**\ =YES, the default value, uses the color plot display method.
**SCR**\ =NO uses the character plot display method. The value of
**SCR** determines the plot display method for all the plots specified
in a problem. If **SCR**\ = is entered more than once, the last entry
determines the plot display method. In other words, all plots generated
by a problem will be either character plots or color plots.

The plot data can include the data for any or all types of plots. A plot
by mixture number is the default. The kind of plot is defined by the
parameter **PIC=**. Character plots are printed after the volumes are
printed and before the final preparations for tracking are completed.
Plot data are not required for a problem, but theyb can be used to
verify the problem description. The actual plotting of the picture can
be suppressed by entering **PLT= NO** in the parameter data or plot
data. This allows plot data to be kept in the problem input for
reference purposes without actually plotting the picture(s). Entering a
value for **PLT** in the plot data will override any value entered in
the parameter data. However, if a problem is restarted, the value of
**PLT** from the parameter data is used. The upper left and lower right
coordinates of the plot must be specified relative to the origin of the
problem. See :ref:`8-1-3-9` for a discussion of plot origins and plot
data.

Enter the plot data using the following syntax:

**READ PLOT** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END PLOT**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters entered using keywords followed by the
  appropriate data. The plot title and the plot character string must be
  contained within delimiters. Enter as many picture parameters as
  necessary to describe the plot. Multiple sets of plot data can be
  entered. The parameter input for each plot is terminated by a labeled or
  unlabeled **END**. The labeled **END** cannot use the word **PLOT** as
  the first four characters of the label. For example, **END PLT1** is a
  valid label, but **END PLOT1** is not. If an unlabeled **END** is used,
  it cannot start in column 1.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **PLOT** block are
described below.

**TTL=** *delim ptitl delim*
  Enter a one-character delimiter *delim* to
  signal the beginning of the title (132 characters maximum). The title is
  terminated when *delim* is encountered the second time. Acceptable
  delimiters include “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !.
  Default = title of the KENO case.

**PIC=** *wrd*
The plot type, *wrd*, is followed by one or more blanks
and must be one of the keywords listed below. The plot type is
initialized to MAT; the default is the value from the previous plot.

  is used to enter the Z coordinate of the lower right-hand
  corner of the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if any other
  coordinates are entered.

Direction cosines across the plot
  Enter direction numbers proportional to the direction cosines for the AX axis of the plot.
  The AX axis is from left to right across the plot. If any one of the AX direction cosines is entered,
  the other two are set to zero. The direction cosines are normalized by the code.

  **UAX=** *uax* is used to enter the X component of the direction
  cosines for the AX axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  **VAX=** *vax* is used to enter the Y component of the direction
  cosines for the AX axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  **WAX=** *wax* is used to enter the Z component of the direction

  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

Direction cosines down the plot
  Enter direction numbers proportional
  to the direction cosines for the DN axis of the plot.
  The DN axis is from top to bottom down the plot. If any one of the DN direction
  cosines is entered, the other two are set to zero. The direction cosines are normalized
  by the code.

  **UDN=** *udn* is used to enter the X component of the direction
  cosines for the DN axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  cosines for the DN axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

Scaling parameters
  Enter one or more scaling parameters to define the
  size of the plot.

  .. note:: If any of the scaling parameters are entered for a plot,
   the value of those that were not entered is recalculated. If none of
   the scaling parameters are specified for a plot, the values from the
   previous plot are used.

**DLX=** *dlx*
  is used to input the horizontal spacing between points on
  the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if
  **NAX** or **NDN** is entered.

**DLD=** *dld*
  is used to input the vertical spacing between points on
  the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if
  **NAX** or **NDN** is entered.

.. note:: If either DLX or DLD is entered, the code will calculate the
  value of the other. If both are entered, the plot may be distorted.

**NAX=** *nax*
  is used to input the number of intervals to be printed
  across the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero
  if **DLX** or **DLD** is entered.

**NDN=** *ndn*
  is used to input the number of intervals to be printed
  down the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero
  if **DLX** or **DLD** is entered.

Global scaling parameter

**LPI=** *lpi*
  is used to input a scaling factor used to control the
  horizontal to vertical proportionality of a plot or plots. SCALE 4.3 and
  later versions allow *lpi* to be input as a floating point number. For
  an undistorted character plot, *lpi* should be specified as the number
  of characters down the page that occupy the same distance as ten
  characters across the page. For an undistorted color plot, *lpi* should
  be entered as ten times the ratio of the vertical pixel dimension to the
  horizontal pixel dimension. The default value of *lpi* is 8.0 for a
  character plot and 10.0 for a color plot. *lpi*\ =10 will usually
  display an undistorted color plot.

  The value entered for *lpi* applies to all plot data following it
  until a new value of *lpi* is specified.

  .. note:: Plot data must include the specification of the upper left
    corner of the plot and the direction cosines across and down the
    plot.

    Additional data required to generate a plot are one of the following
    combinations:

    1. the lower right corner of the plot, the global scaling parameter,
    **LPI**, and one of the scaling parameters (**DLX**, **DLD**,
    **NAX**, **NDN**).

    2. the lower right corner of the plot, one of the scaling parameters
    related to the horizontal specifications of the plot (**DLX** or
    **NAX**), and one of the scaling parameters related to the vertical
    specification of the plot (**DLD** or **NDN**). **LPI**, even if
    specified will not be used.

    3. **NAX** and **NDN** and any two of **LPI, DLX**, and **DLD**. If
    **LPI, DLX**, and **DLD** are all specified, **LPI** is not used.

    The data required to generate a plot may be supplied from
    (1) defaulted values, (2) data from the previous plot, or (3) data
    that are specifically entered for the current plot.

Miscellaneous parameters
  Enter miscellaneous parameters

**RUN**\ = *run*
  is used to determine if the problem is executed or is
  terminated after data checking. A value of YES for *run* means the
  problem will be executed if all the data were acceptable. A value of NO
  specifies the problem will be terminated after data checking is
  completed. The default value of **RUN** is YES.

**PLT**\ = *plt*
  is used to specify if a plot is to be made. A value of
  YES for *plt* specifies that a plot is to be made. If plot data are
  entered, **PLT** is defaulted to YES.

.. note:: The parameters **RUN** and **PLT** can also be entered in the
  PARAMETER data. See :ref:`8-1-2-3`. It is recommended that these
  parameters be entered only in the parameter data block in order to
  ensure that the data printed in the “Logical Parameters” table are what
  is actually performed.

**SCR=** *src*
  This is used to determine the plot display method. The
  plot display method is specified by entering either YES or NO for *src*.
  The default value is YES. **SCR**\ =YES uses the color plot display
  method. **SCR**\ =NO uses the character plot display method. If **SCR**
  is entered more than once in a problem, the last value entered is the
  one that is used.

**NCH=** *delim char delim*
  Enter only if plots are to be made utilizing
  the character plot display method (**SCR**\ =NO). Enter a delimiter
  (i.e., “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !) to signal the beginning of character
  string *char*. The character string is terminated when the *delim*
  character is encountered the second time. Do not use the initial
  delimiter in the *char* string, as it will be read as terminating the
  string. *char* is a character string with each entry representing a
  plottable quantity (i.e., media {mixture} number, unit number, or bias
  ID). These are the characters that will be used in the plot. The first
  entry represents media, unit, or bias ID zero; the second entry
  represents the smallest media, unit, or bias ID used in the problem; the
  third entry represents the next larger media, unit, or bias ID used in
  the problem; etc. For example, assume **PIC**\ =MAT is specified, and
  15 mixtures are defined in the mixing table, and the geometry data use
  only mixtures 3 and 7. By default, a blank will be printed for mixture
  zero, a 1 will be printed for mixture 3, and a 2 will be printed for
  mixture 7. If you wish to print a zero for a void (mixture 0), a 3 for
  mixture 3, and a 7 for mixture 7, enter NCH=‘037’.

The default values of CHAR are the following:

  +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+
  | Quantity | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5     | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15 |

  this entry is used to define the colors to be used by the color plot.
  It may be entered only if plots are to be made utilizing the color
  plot display method (**SCR**\ =YES). After entering the keyword
  **CLR=**, 4 numbers are entered *N* times. The first number, *n*\ :sub:`1`,
  represents a media (mixture) number, unit number, or bias ID. The
  next three numbers, whose values can range from 0 through 255, define
  the *red, green, and blue* components of the color that will
  represent this *n*\ :sub:`1` in the plot. The sequence of 4 numbers is
  repeated until the colors associated with all of the media (mixture)
  numbers, unit numbers, or bias IDs used in the problem have been
  defined. The smallest number that can be entered for *n*\ :sub:`i` is −1,
  representing undefined regions in the plot. An *n\ i* of 0 represents
  void regions; *n*\ :sub:`i` of 1 represents the smallest media, unit, or
  bias ID used in the problem; *n*\ :sub:`i` of 2 represents the next larger
  media, unit, or bias ID used in the problem, etc. The color plot
  definition data are terminated by entering the keywords **END
  COLOR**. A total of 256 default colors are provided in :numref:`tab8-1-22`
  Two of those colors represent undefined regions, *n*\ :sub:`i`\ =-1*, as
  black and void regions, and *n*\ :sub:`i`\ =0 as gray. The remaining 254
  colors represent the default values for mixtures, bias IDs, or unit
  numbers used in the problem. If **num** is entered as **−1**, the
  next three numbers define the color that will be used to represent
  undefined regions of the plot. The default color for undefined
  regions is black, represented as 0 0 0. If *n*\ :sub:`i` is entered as 0,
  the next three numbers define the color that will represent void
  regions in the plot. The default color for void is gray, represented
  as 200 200 200. For example, assume a color plot is to be made for a
  problem that uses void regions and mixture numbers 1, 3, and 5. By
  default, the undefined regions (Index −1) will be black; void regions
  (Index 0) will be gray; the first mixture, mixture 1 (Index 1), will
  be medium blue; the next larger mixture, mixture 3 (Index 2), will be
  turquoise2; and the last mixture, mixture 5 (Index 3), will be
  green2. If these values are acceptable, data do not need to be
  entered for **CLR**\ =. If the user decides to define void to be
  white (255 255 255), mixture 1 to be red (255 0 0), mixture 3 to be
  bright blue (0 0 255), and mixture 5 to be green (0 255 0), then the
  following data could be entered:

  **CLR**\ =0 255 255 255 1 255 0 0 2 0 0 255 3 0 255 0 **END COLOR**

  In this example, the first number (0) defines the void, and the next
  three numbers are the *red, green, and blue* components that combine
  as the color white. The fifth number (1) represents the smallest
  mixture number (mixture 1), and the next three numbers are the *red,
  green, and blue* components of red. The ninth number (2) represents
  the next larger mixture number (mixture 3), and the next three
  numbers are the *red, green, and blue* components of bright blue. The
  thirteenth number (3) represents the next larger mixture number
  (mixture 5), and the next three numbers are the red, green, and blue
  components of green. The **END COLOR** terminates the color
  definition data. Because color data were not entered for *n\ i* of
  −1, undefined regions will be represented by the color black, the
  default specification from :numref:`tab8-1-22`. The *red, green, and blue*
  components of some bright colors are listed below.

Energy group boundary data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upper energy group boundary data in eV are entered to determine the
groups into which the tallies will be collected in the continuous energy
mode. For *G* groups *G*\ +1 entries are entered. The last entry is the
lower energy boundary of the last group. The values must be in
descending order. The parameter **NGP** is set equal to the number of
entries−1. The syntax is:

**READ ENERGY** *u*\ :sub:`1` …u\ *G* *u*\ :sub:`G+1` **END ENERGY**

*u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`G`
  are the upper energy limits of energy groups 1 … *G*,
  respectively.

*u*\ :sub:`G+1`
  is the lower energy limit of energy group *G*.

Example:

  **READ ENERGY**

  2e7 1e5 1 1e−5

  **END ENERGY**

Defines a 3-group structure with group 1 (2e+7 eV to 1e+5 eV), group 2
(1e+5 eV to 1 eV), and group 3 (1 eV to 1e−5 eV) and sets **NGP**\ =3.

Energy group boundary data are optional. Default values for the energy
group boundaries in the calculations are determined as in the following
order:

  i.   Use energy group boundaries from **READ ENERGY** block if specified
       in the input. The number of entries in the **READ ENERGY** block is
       **NGP**\ +1.

  ii.  If only **NGP** is specified (in **READ PARAMETER**) in the input
       and **NGP** is equal to the number of energy groups in one of the
       SCALE neutron cross section libraries, the energy group structure
       from that library will be used.

  iii. If only **NGP** is specified (in **READ PARAMETER**) in the input
       and **NGP** is not equal to the number of energy groups in one of
       the SCALE neutron cross section libraries, **NGP** equal lethargy
       bins will be used.

  iv.  Use SCALE 238 group structure as default, **NGP**\ =238.

Volume data
~~~~~~~~~~~

If volumes are needed (for calculating fission densities, fluxes, etc.),
then the data necessary to determine them are entered. The syntax for
this block is:

**READ VOLUME** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END VOLUME**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters entered using keywords followed by the
  appropriate data.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **VOLUME** block are
described below.

**READVOL**\ =\ *vol*
  used to input the file name (up to 256 characters)
  of the file from which user-specified volumes are read. This is an
  optional parameter and only works for KENO-VI. The data are read in
  sections for each **UNIT** contained in the problem. First the keyword
  “\ **UNIT**\ ” is read, followed by the **UNIT** number. For that
  **UNIT** the data for each region containing material in the order shown
  in the input is read as follows: the keyword “\ **MEDIA**\ ” is read,
  followed by the mixture number, followed by the keyword “\ **VOL**\ =”,
  followed by the total volume for that region. Regions containing
  **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s are skipped. An example of the data
  contained in a volume file is given later in this section.

**TYPE**\ =\ *vcalc*
  used to determine the type of volume calculation.
  *vcalc* can have the values:

   NONE: (only works in KENO-VI, where it is also the default) No volume
   calculation, volumes are set to –1.0 (only in KENO-VI).

   TRACE: A trapezoidal integration will be performed (only in KENO‑VI).

   RANDOM: A Monte Carlo integration will be performed.

**NRAYS**\ =\ *ntotal*
  the number of intervals used in the trapezoidal
  integration (default 100,000). Used only with TYPE=TRACE (KENO-VI).

**BATCHES**\ =\ *nloop*
  the number of batches to be used in the
  Monte Carlo integration (default 500). Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**POINTS**\ =nplp
  the number of points per batch used in the Monte Carlo
  integration (default 1000). Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**XP**\ =\ *xp*
  the plus X face of the encompassing cuboid.

**XM**\ =\ *xm*
  the minus X face of the encompassing cuboid.

**YP**\ =\ *yp*
  the plus Y face of the encompassing cuboid.

**YM**\ =\ *ym*
  the minus Y face of the encompassing cuboid.

**ZP**\ =\ *zp*
  the plus Z face of the encompassing cuboid.

**ZM**\ =\ *zm*
  the minus Z face of the encompassing cuboid.

**SAMPLE_DEN=**\ *sampleden*
  the density of sampling points per
  cm\ :sup:`3` per batch. Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**IFACE** =\ *fname*
  the face of the enclosing cuboid where the
  trapezoidal integration will be performed. Enter either **XFACE**,
  **YFACE**, or **ZFACE**. KENO-VI will integrate over the face with the
  smallest area by default. This allows specifying a different face. Used
  only for **TYPE**\ =TRACE (KENO-VI).

The volume parameters include specifying the type of calculation to
determine the volumes and additional parameters needed for the selected
type. In KENO-VI the default type is NONE (i.e., no volume calculation
will be performed), and the volumes for regions not containing
**HOLE**\ s or **ARRAY**\ s will be set to -1.0. No other data are
needed for this type.

In KENO-VI the volume data may be entered for any or all regions within
the geometry data by placing the keyword **VOL**\ = followed by the
total volume of that region in the problem at the end of the **MEDIA**
card. See :ref:`8-1-2-4` (Geometry Data) for more details.

For KENO-VI, in the same problem, volumes may be entered using a
combination of three methods: (1) in the geometry data using **VOL**\ =,
(2) read from a volume file, and (3) calculated. The calculated volumes
(method 3) are obtained for both the regions, and the meshes are defined
by a grid (such as in TSUNAMI runs). As for KENO V.a, the mesh volumes
must always be calculated (i.e., there is no method to input the mesh
volumes). If volumes are entered or calculated using more than one
method, the following hierarchy is used to determine which volume is
used for the regions.

1. Volumes entered as part of a **MEDIA** card using **VOL**\ = are
   always used.

2. Volumes read from the volume file are used if that volume for the
   region was not specified using VOL= following a **MEDIA** card.

3. Calculated volumes are used if they are not specified using
   **VOL**\ = and if there is no volume file or data for that region on
   the volume file.

4. Volumes that have not been set or calculated will be set to –1.0.
   This may result in negative fluxes and fission densities for these
   regions.

5. Volumes are only calculated for regions containing material. Regions
   containing **ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s have no volume. Those volumes
   are associated with the **UNIT** contained in the **ARRAY** or
   **HOLE**.

In KENO V.a, the region volumes are always calculated by the code
without the user’s intervention. This is possible because KENO V.a has
no region intersections, so calculation of the volumes is always
possible using analytical methods. The use of the (RANDOM) calculated
volumes using the **VOLUME** block is then only justified when the user
needs to calculate the volumes defined by a grid, such as for TSUNAMI
calculations.

When volumes are calculated using either RANDOM or TRACE, then a file
containing volumes and named \_volxxxx (where xxxx is an 18-digit number
with the leftmost unused digits padded with zeros) is created in the
temporary directory. The program searches the temporary directory for a
file name beginning with \_vol. If it is not found, the volume file that
is created is named \_vol000000000000000000. If a file exists, then a
new file will be created where the file number is the largest number
associated with a previous volume file incremented by 1. The file is
automatically copied to the user directory with the input file base name
prepended to it, such as inputfile.volxxxx.volumes.

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
in which volumes are being calculated using ray tracing. The number of
rays used is set to one million, and if the outer unit volume is not a
cuboid, then a cuboid will be placed around the global region prior to
calculating volumes.

::

  read volume
  type=trace nrays=1000000
  XP=10  XM=-15 YP=15  YM=-15  ZP=15  ZM=-15
  end volume

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
where volumes are being calculated using random sampling. The number of
particles per batch is set to 100,000, and the number of batches used is
set to 500. After being calculated, the volume data will be written to a
file in the temporary directory as discussed above.

::

  read volume
  type=random points=100000 batches=500
  XP=10  XM=-10  YP=15  YM=-15  ZP=25  ZM=15
  end volume

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
where volumes are both read in from the file VOLUME_DATA and calculated
using random sampling. The number of particles per generation is set to
1,000,000, and the number of generations used is set to 500. The file
VOLUME_DATA must be formatted as shown below. The calculated volume data
are written in the temporary working directory to a file as discussed
above. Calculating volume data for some volume regions and providing
input volume data for others may be useful if only part of the volume
data is known and the remaining data need to be calculated.

::

  read volume
  type=random points=1000000 batches=500
  readvol=volume_DAta
  end volume

Example volume file VOLUME_DATA:

::

  UNIT 1
     MEDIA 1 VOL=110.0
     MEDIA 2 VOL=2435.8
     MEDIA 2 VOL=3242.9
  UNIT 2
     MEDIA 2 VOL=342.8
     MEDIA 0 VOL=4235.0

Below is an example of a sample problem in which volumes are being
calculated using random sampling. The number of particles per generation
is set to 100,000, and the number of generations used is set to 500.
After being calculated, the **VOLUME** data will be written as described
above.

  maximum cell boundary in the x direction, default =
  1.

**YMIN**\ =\ *ymin*
  minimum cell boundary in the y direction, default =
  0.

**YMAX**\ =\ *ymax*
  maximum cell boundary on the y direction, default =
  1.

**ZMIN**\ =\ *zmin*
  minimum cell boundary in the z direction, default =
  0.

**ZMAX=**\ *zmax*
  maximum cell boundary in the z direction, default = 1.

**XPLANES**\ =\ *xplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the x direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**YPLANES**\ =\ *yplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the y direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**ZPLANES**\ =\ *zplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the z direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**XLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsx *x*\ :sub:`min` *x*\ :sub:`max`
  generate y-z planes from
  x\ :sub:`min` to x\ :sub:`max` creating *numcellsx* intervals.

**YLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsy *y*\ :sub:`min` *y*\ :sub:`max`
  generate x-z planes from
  y\ :sub:`min` to y\ :sub:`max`, creating *numcellsy* intervals.

**ZLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsz *z*\ :sub:`min` *z*\ :sub:`max`
  generate x-y planes from
  z\ :sub:`min` to z\ :sub:`max`, creating *numcellsz* intervals.

**TITLE**\ =\ *title*
  optional title for this mesh grid. Only used in
  KENO if an error in the grid causes a debug print.

If *numx, xmin, xmax* are entered, then the code will calculate *numx*
equally spaced cells in the x direction between *xmin* and *xmax*.

If *xplanes* is entered, then the code will count the number of unique
*xplanes*, and order them from minimum to maximum, deleting any
duplicates.

If the user inputs both sets of data, then the code will use the
*xplanes* data.

If *xplanes* and *xlinear* are both entered, then the code will retain
all unique planes from *xplanes* and all *xlinear* entries provided. The
above also applies to Y and Z.

**NOTE**: The user **MUST** set the minimum and maximum values in each
direction so that the actual geometry is totally covered by the mesh for
mesh flux tally that is used in TSUNAMI sensitivity calculations.

KENO checks for and eliminates duplicate or nearly duplicate planes.

The user may specify multiple mesh grids; each must be defined in
separate **READ GRID** blocks. In this case, each grid should have
different *N* (grid ID number). See :ref:`8-1-3-10` for details and
samples.

Reaction data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reaction data block is used to specify the type of tally (e.g.,
reaction rates, flux, and few group reaction cross sections) and the
reaction/nuclide pairs in any mixture used in the problem for reaction
tally calculations. This block is operational only with the continuous
energy mode, and it provides the specifications for reaction rate,
neutron flux, and reaction cross section tallies. See :ref:`8-1-6-6` for
more details. For multigroup KENO calculations, use KMART5 or KMART6,
which are described in the KMART section of the SCALE manual.

A reaction data block consists of REACTION FILTERS, TALLY TYPE, ENERGY
GROUP BOUNDARIES, and OUTPUT EDITS. These data types can be entered in
any order. A combination of parameters for describing the REACTION
FILTERS and TALLY TYPE must be entered for any reaction or cross section
tally calculation. ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES and OUTPUT EDITS data are
optional. Tally calculations can be performed for multiple reactions
specified by the REACTION FILTERS. Only one energy grid, either
specified with the data in ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES or from the READ
ENERGY block or from the code defaults, is used for all reaction tally
calculations. To provide data for the continuous energy depletion
calculations, another energy grid can be specified and used for tallying
only the mixture flux.

Enter REACTION DATA in the form:

**READ REACTION** *REACTION FILTERS [TALLY TYPE] [ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES]\
        [OUTPUT EDITS]* **END REACTION**

*REACTION FILTERS*
  define a reaction map that is used in reaction tally
  calculations. The *REACTION FILTERS* must be entered in the following
  order; mixture data (**MIX** or **MIXLIST**) followed by nuclide data
  (**NUC** or **NUCLIST**) followed by reaction IDs (**MT** or
  **MTLIST**). Each filter is defined using a combination of the following
  keywords:

**MIX**\ =\ *mixnum*
  Mixture number, no default value. Specified mixture
  number must exist in the mixing table and be used in the problem for a
  valid filter generation. A wildcard “\ *\**\ ” can be used to define a
  filter applicable for all mixtures in the problem.

**MIXLIST** *mixnum*\ :sub:`1` *mixnum*\ :sub:`2` … *mixnum*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of mixture
  numbers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified mixture numbers
  must exist in the mixing table and be used in the problem for a valid
  reaction tally calculation. Within each filter, use either **MIX** or
  **MIXLIST**, but not both.

**NUC**\ =\ *nucid*
  Nuclide identifier, no default value. Specified
  nuclide must be a constituent of the mixtures used in this filter
  definition (specified with MIX or MIXLIST). A wildcard “*” can be used
  to define a filter applicable for all nuclides in each mixture in this
  filter definition. Nuclide identifiers are listed for all isotopes in
  the Standard Composition Library section of the SCALE manual (see :ref:`7-2`).

**NUCLIST** *nucid*\ :sub:`1` *nucid*\ :sub:`2` … *nucid*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of nuclide
  identifiers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified nuclides
  must be the constituents of the mixtures used in this filter definition
  (specified by **MIX** or **MIXLIST**). Within each filter, use either
  **NUC** or **NUCLIST**, but not both.

**MT**\ =\ *mt*
  Reaction MT number, no default value. Specified reaction
  MT number should be available for the nuclides defined in this filter
  definition (specified by **NUC** or **NUCLIST**). Otherwise, the code
  skips the filter definition with this given reaction MT. A wildcard “*”
  can be used to define a filter with all reaction MTs. Valid SCALE
  library MT values are listed in the SCALE Cross Section Libraries
  section of the SCALE manual (see Appendix A of :ref:`11-1`).

**MTLIST** *mt*\ :sub:`1` *mt*\ :sub:`2` … *mt*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of reaction **MT**
  numbers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified MT numbers
  should be available for the nuclides defined in this filter definition
  (specified by **MIX** or **MIXLIST**). Otherwise, KENO skips that
  reaction specified in the filter for the reaction tally calculations.
  Within each filter, use either **MT** or **MTLIST**, but not both.

A reaction filter consists of either single or multiple mixture, nuclide
and reaction definitions. A valid reaction filter starts with mixture
specification, followed by nuclide specification, and ends with reaction
specification. Mixture(s) must be specified with either **MIX** or
**MIXLIST** keywords. Nuclide(s) in these mixtures must be entered with
either **NUC** or **NUCLIST**, and reactions for each nuclide must be
specified with either **MT** or **MTLIST**.

Mixture, nuclide, and reaction number are required for mixture average
fluxes, even though the nuclide and reaction numbers are not used for
the neutron flux tallies.

Multiple reaction filter definitions are allowed. KENO processes all the
definitions and creates a reaction map based on them. The following
examples demonstrate the reaction filter specifications for different
problems. In these examples, reaction filters are specified based on the
following composition data used in the problem:

Parameters of TALLY TYPE are logical parameters used to select
quantities (reaction cross section, reaction rate, and mixture flux)
that are tallied for the given problem. The user specifies any
combination of these TALLY TYPEs once for all filters:

**XSTALLY**\ *=lCEXSTally*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that reaction cross
   sections be tallied for the reactions listed in *REACTION FILTERS*.
   The default value of **XSTALLY** is NO. Computed reaction cross
   sections are saved in a file named *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs.0* in
   RTNDIR, which is a SCALE environment variable for the directory from
   where the calculation was started. BASENAME is a SCALE environment
   variable that is the base name of the input file. (BASENAME is equal
   to *“mytest”* if the SCALE input name is *“mytest.inp.”*)

**RRTALLY**\ *=lCERRTally*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that reaction rates be
   tallied for the reactions listed in *REACTION FILTERS*. The default
   value of RRTALLY is NO. Computed reaction rates are saved in a file
   named *BASENAME_keno_micro_rr.0* in RTNDIR.

.. note:: KENO combines and saves reaction rate and reaction cross
  section tallies to the same file, named *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_rr.0* in
  RTNDIR, if both **XSTALLY** and **RRTALLY** are set to YES.

**MIXFLX**\ *=lCEMixFlux*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that mixture fluxes are to
   be tallied for the mixtures listed in *REACTION FILTERS*. The default
   value of **MIXFLX** is NO. Computed mixture fluxes are saved in a
   file named *BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux.0* in RTNDIR.

   Mixture, nuclide, and reaction number are required for mixture
   average fluxes, even though the nuclide and reaction numbers are not
   used for the neutron flux tallies.

::

  READ REACTION
 	    MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	    XSTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT**\ =18) of

  READ REACTION
 	    MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	    XSTALLY=YES RRTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT=**\ 18) of
:sup:`235`\ U in mixture 10, for tallying reaction rates as well as the
reaction cross sections.

.. note:: Computed data are saved in files named
  *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_rr.0*

Example-13:

::

  READ REACTION
 	  MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	   XSTALLY=YES MIXFLX=YES
 	   …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT=**\ 18) of
:sup:`235`\ U in mixture 10, for tallying reaction cross sections. In
addition, mixture flux is tallied for mixture 10 given in this reaction
filter.

.. note:: Computed data are saved in files named
  *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs.0*, and *BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux.0*,
  respectively.

*ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES* data define energy group structure other than
the defaults for tallying both reaction cross sections/reaction rates
and mixture fluxes.

**ENER_XS** *e\ 1 e\ 2 e\ 3 …*\ **END** Upper energy boundary for each
group. The last entry is the lower energy boundary of the last group.
For N groups, there are N+1 entries. Entries must be in descending
order. This may be specified once in the REACTION block and, if used, is
applied to all cross section and reaction rate tallies.

**ENER_FLX** *e\ 1 e\ 2 e\ 3 …*\ **END** Upper energy boundary for each
group, default is **NGP**-group data. The last entry is the lower energy
boundary of the last group. For N groups, there are N +1 entries.
Entries must be in descending order. This may be specified once in the
REACTION block and, if used, is applied to all mixture flux tallies.

.. note:: Default values for the energy group boundaries in reaction
  tally calculations are determined as in the order described in :ref:`8-1-2-12`.

Example-14: (no **READ ENERGY** block, no **NGP** in **READ PARAMETER**
block, no energy group

::

  READ REACTION
 	  MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
	   MTLIST 16 17 18 END
	    MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Default SCALE 238-group energy structure is used for tallying both
mixture flux and reaction cross sections.

 	   …
  END REACTION

	   MTLIST 16 17 18 END
	   MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES
 	   …
  END REACTION

4-group energy group structure (4-equal lethargy bins) is used for
tallying both mixture flux and reaction cross sections.

Example-17:

::

  READ REACTION
     	MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
    	MTLIST 16 17 18 END

     	 …
  END REACTION

3-group energy group structure given in **READ REACTION** block is used
for tallying reaction cross sections, and default SCALE 238 group energy
structure is used for tallying mixture flux.

Example-18:

  READ REACTION
     	MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
    	MTLIST 16 17 18 END
    	MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES

    	ENER_XS 20.E6 1.0 1.E-4 END
     	 …
  END REACTION

2-group energy group structure given in **READ REACTION** block is used
for tallying reaction cross sections, and 3-group energy group structure
given in **READ REACTION** block is used for tallying mixture flux.

Parameters of *OUTPUT EDITS* are logical parameters used to print
reaction tallies and mixture fluxes in separate files. These parameters
are optional parameters.

**PRNTXS**\ *=lCEprintXS* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that
reaction cross sections tallies for each mixture be written in separate
files in RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_mix{mixnum}.0, mixnum* is the
mixture numbers specified in the reaction filters)\ *.* The default
value of **PRNTXS** is NO.

**PRNTRR**\ *=lCEprintRR* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that
reaction rate tallies for each mixture be written in separate files in
RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_micro_rr_mix{mixnum}.0, mixnum* is the mixture
numbers specified in the reaction filters)\ *.* The default value of
**PRNTRR** is NO.

**PRNTFLX**\ *=lCEprintMixFlux* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES
specifies that mixture flux tallies for each mixture be written in
separate files in RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux_mix{mixnum}.0,

Notes for Keno Users
--------------------

This section provides assorted tips designed to assist the KENO user with problem mockups.
Some information concerning methods used by KENO is also included.

.. _8-1-3-1:

Data entry
~~~~~~~~~~

The KENO data is entered in blocks that begin and end with keywords as
described in :ref:`8-1-2-1`. Only one set of parameter data can be
entered for a problem. However, for other data blocks, it is possible to
enter more than one block of the same kind of data. When this is done,
only the last block of that kind of data is retained for use by the
problem, except for the GRID block for which all blocks are retained.

Within data blocks, a number, x, can be repeated n times by specifying
nRx, n*x, or n$x.

Numbers in engineering notation may be specified with or without an “E”
between the base and the exponent. For example; 0.0011 may be specified
as 1.1e-3 or as 1.1-3.

.. _8-1-3-1-1:

Multiple and scattered entries in the mixing table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following examples, assume 1001 is the nuclide ID for hydrogen,
8016 is the nuclide ID for oxygen, 92235 is the nuclide ID for
:sup:`235`\ U, and 92238 is the nuclide ID for :sup:`238`\ U. If a given
nuclide ID is used more than once in the same mixture, the result is the
summing of all the number densities associated with that nuclide. For
example:

**MIX**\ =1 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 92235 1.1e-3 8016
1.8e-2

would be the same as entering:

**MIX**\ =1 92235 4.41e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 8016 1.8e-2

A belated entry for a mixture can be made as follows:

**MIX**\ =1 1001 6.6e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 MIX=1 8016
3.3e-2

This is the same as entering:

**MIX**\ =1 1001 6.6e-2 8016 3.3e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3

.. _8-1-3-1-2:

Multiple entries in geometry data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual geometry regions cannot be replaced by adding an additional
description. However, entire unit descriptions can be replaced by adding
a new description having the same unit number. The last description
entered for a unit is used in the calculation. For example, the
following geometry descriptions are equivalent in KENO V.a and KENO-VI,
respectively:

In KENO V.a:

The order of entry for **UNIT** descriptions is not important because
the **UNIT** number is assigned as the value following the word
**UNIT**. They do not need to be entered sequentially, and they do not
need to be numbered sequentially. It is perfectly acceptable to enter
**UNIT**\ s 2, 3, and 5, omitting Units 1 and 4 as long as **UNIT**\ s 1
and 4 are not referenced in the problem. It is also acceptable to
scramble the order of entry as in entering **UNIT**\ s 3, 2, and 5.

Parameter input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the parameter data block is entered for a problem, the same keyword
may be entered several times. The last value that is entered is used in
the problem. Data may be entered as follows:

::

  READ PARAM  FLX=YES NPG=1000 TME=0.5 TME=1.0
  NPG=50 TME=10.0 FLX=NO
  NPG=500
  END PARA

This will result in the problem having **FLX=NO**, **TME=10.0**, and
**NPG=500**. It may be more convenient for the user to insert a new
value than to change the existing data.

Certain parameter default values should not be overridden unless the
user has a very good reason to do so. These parameters are as follows:

   1. **X1D=** which defines the number of extra 1-D cross sections. The
   use of extra 1‑D cross sections—other than the use of the fission
   cross section for calculating the average number of neutrons per
   fission—requires programming changes to the code;

   2. **NFB=** which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
   in the fission bank (the fission bank is where the information
   related to a fission is stored);

   3. **XFB=** which defines the number of extra positions in the
   fission bank;

   4. **NBK=** which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
   in the neutron bank (the neutron bank contains information about each
   history);

   5. **XNB=** which defines the number of extra positions in the
   neutron bank;

   6. **WTH=** which defines the factor that determines when splitting
   occurs;

   7. **WTA=** which defines the default average weight given to a
   neutron that survives Russian roulette;

   8. **WTL=** which defines the factor that determines when Russian
   roulette is played; and

   9. **LNG=** which sets the maximum words of storage available to the
   program.

It is recommended that **BUG=**, the flag for printing debug
information, **never** be set to YES. The user would have to look at the
FORTRAN coding to determine what information is printed. **BUG**\ =YES
prints massive amounts of sparsely labeled information. The user should
only rarely consider using **TRK**\ =YES. This generates thousands of
lines of well-labeled output that provides information about each
history at key locations during the tracking procedure. All other
parameters can be changed at will to provide features the user wishes to
activate.

.. _8-1-3-4:

Cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In multi-energy group mode, KENO always uses cross sections from a mixed
cross section data file. The format of this file is the Monte Carlo
processed cross section file. A mixed cross section file can be created
by previous KENO run, or  by using an AMPX working format library and
entering mixing table data in KENO.

.. _8-1-3-4-1:

Use a mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library (premixed cross section
data file) from a previous KENO case may be used. This file is specified
using the parameter **XSC**\ =. If a mixing table data block is entered,
the premixed cross section data file will be rewritten. Therefore, a
mixing table should not be entered if a premixed cross section data file
is used. The user should verify that the mixtures created by a previous
KENO case are consistent with those used in the geometry data of the
problem.

.. _8-1-3-4-2:

Use an AMPX working format library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an AMPX working format library is used, it must be specified using
the parameter **LIB**\ =, and mixing table data must always be entered.
IDs used in the mixing table must match the IDs on the AMPX working
format library. The user must provide a file with the correct cross
sections with a name that matches the pattern ftNNf001, with NN being
the number of the logical unit.

.. _8-1-3-4-3:

Number of scattering angles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of scattering angles is defaulted to 1 (defaulted to 2 when
KENO-VI is run as part of the CSAS6 sequence). This stand alone default
is not adequate for many applications. The user should specify the
scattering angle to be consistent with the cross sections being used.
The number of scattering angles is entered in the cross section mixing
table by using the keyword **SCT**\ =. See :ref:`8-1-2-10`.

The order of the last Legendre coefficient to be preserved in the
scattering distribution is equal to (2 × SCT − 1). **SCT**\ =1 could be
used with a P\ :sub:`1` cross section set such as the 16-group
Hansen-Roach cross section library, and **SCT**\ =2, for a P\ :sub:`3`
cross section set such as the SCALE 27-group cross section library.
ENDF/B-V cross section libraries such as the 44-group or 238-group
libraries contain many nuclides having P\ :sub:`5` cross section sets.
Isotropic scattering is achieved by entering **SCT**\ =0.

.. _8-1-3-4-4:

Cross section message cutoff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cross section message cutoff value, *pbxs*, is defaulted to
3 × 10\ :sup:`−5`. Warning messages generated when errors are
encountered in the P\ :sub:`L` expansion of the group-to-group transfers
will be suppressed if the P\ :sub:`0` cross section for that particular
energy transfer is less than *pbxs*. The value of *pbxs* is specified in
the cross section mixing table by using the keyword **EPS**\ =. See
:ref:`8-1-2-10`.

The default value of *pbxs* is sufficient to assure that warning
messages will not be printed for most of the SCALE P\ :sub:`1` and
P\ :sub:`3` cross section libraries. However, the v7.0-238n library may
print a few errors if P\ :sub:`5` cross sections are specified.

The error messages below were printed for a problem using the 238-group
cross section library and *pbxs* = 3.0 × 10\ :sup:`–5`. If the default
value of *pbxs* allows too many warning messages to be printed, a value
can be determined which does not print the error messages from the
printed messages by choosing a number larger than the P\ :sub:`0`
component on the first line, as shown below.

For the following messages, **EPS**\ =6.9e−5 would cause all three
messages to be suppressed. A value less than 5.615159e−5 and greater
than 4.767635e−5 would suppress the second message, and a value less
than 6.855362e−5 and greater than 5.615159e−5 would suppress the first
two messages.

The user does not need to attempt to suppress all these messages. They
are printed to inform the user of the fact that the moments of the
angular distribution are not moments of a valid probability
distribution. The original P\ :sub:`n` coefficients and their moments
are listed in lines 3–6 of the message. Lines 7–10 list the new
corrected moments and their corresponding P\ :sub:`n` coefficients.

The weights and angles printed in lines 11–13 were generated from the
corrected moments. The last two lines of the message list the moments
generated from those weights and angles. They should match line 8, which
lists the moments corresponding to the generated distribution.

For most criticality problems, the first moment contributions are much
more significant than the contributions of the higher order moments.
Thus, the higher order moments may not affect the results significantly.
The user may compare the original moments and corrected moments to make
a judgment as to the significance of the change in the moments.

Mixing table
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mixtures can be used in defining other mixtures. When defining mixture
numbers, care should be taken to avoid using a mixture number that is
identical to a nuclide ID number if the mixture is to be used in
defining another mixture. If a mixture number is defined more than once,
it results in a summing effect.

The nuclide mixing loop is done before the mixture mixing loop, which
performs mixing in the order of data entry. Thus, the order of mixing
mixtures into other mixtures is important because a mixture must be
defined before it can be used in another mixture. Some examples of
correct and incorrect mixing are shown below, using 1001 as the nuclide
ID for hydrogen, 8016 as the nuclide ID for oxygen, 92235 as the nuclide
ID for :sup:`235`\ U, and 92238 as the nuclide ID for :sup:`238`\ U.

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT USAGE

::

    1.	READ MIXT
          MIX=1 1001 6.6e-2  8016 3.3e-2
          MIX=2 1 0.5
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water and mixture 2 being half-density water.

::

    2.	READ MIXT
          MIX=1  2  0.5
          MIX=3  1  0.5
          MIX=2  1001  6.6e-2  8016  3.3e-2
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being half-density water, mixture 2 being
full-density water, and mixture 3 being quarter-density water. Because
the nuclide mixing loop is done first, mixture 2 is created first and is
available to create mixture 1, which is then available to create
mixture 3.

::

    3.  READ MIXT
          MIX=1   1001   6.6e-2   8016   3.3e-2
          MIX=2   92235   7.5e-4   92238   2.3e-2  8016   4.6e-2  1 .01
       END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water and mixture 2 being uranium oxide containing 0.01 density water.

::

    4.  READ MIXT
          MIX=1    1001  6.6e-2    8016  3.3e-2
          MIX=2  92235  4.4e-2  92238  2.6e-3
          MIX=1  1  0.5
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being water at 1.5 density (1001 9.9e-2 and 8016 4.95e-2)
and mixture 2 is highly enriched uranium metal.

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT USAGE


::

      1.	READ MIXT
            MIX=3  1  0.75
            MIX=1  2  0.5
            MIX=2  1001  6.6e-2  8016  3.3e-2
          END MIXT

Here the intent is for mixture 2 to be full-density water, mixture 1 to
be half-density water, and mixture 3 to be 3/8 (0.75 × 0.5) density
water. Instead, the result for mixture 3 is a void, mixture 1 is
half-density water, and mixture 2 is full-density water. This is because
the nuclide mixing loop is done first, thus defining mixture 2. The
mixture mixing loop is done next. Mixture 3 is defined to be mixture 1
multiplied by 0.75, but since mixture 1 has not been defined yet, 0.75
of zero is zero. Mixture 1 is then defined to be mixture 2 multiplied by
0.5. If the definition of mixture 1 preceded the definition of
mixture 3, as in item (2) under examples of correct usage, it would work
correctly.

::

      2.	READ MIXT
            MIX=1         1001   6.6e-2     8016     3.3e-2
            MIX=1001 92235   4.4e-2   92238   2.6e-3
            MIX=2   1001   0.5
          END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water, mixture 1001 being
uranium metal, and mixture 2 being hydrogen with a number density of 0.5
because 1001 is the nuclide ID number for hydrogen. When a mixture
number is identical to a nuclide ID and is used in mixing, that number
is assumed to be a nuclide ID rather than a mixture number. The intent
was for mixture 1 to be full-density water, mixture 1001 to be uranium
metal, and mixture 2 to be half-density uranium metal.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

In general, KENO geometry descriptions consist of (1) geometry data
(:ref:`8-1-2-4`) defining the geometrical shapes present in the problem,
and (2) array data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`) defining the placement of the units
that were defined in the geometry data. The geometry data block is
prefaced by **READ GEOM**, and the array data block is prefaced by
**READ ARRAY**.

When a 3-D geometrical configuration is described as KENO geometry data,
it may be necessary to describe portions of the configuration
individually. These individual partial descriptions of the configuration
are called **UNIT**\ s. KENO geometry modeling is subject to the
following restrictions:

1. Units are composed of regions. These regions are created using
      geometric bodies and surfaces (**shape**\ s) that are previously
      defined.

   1. In KENO-VI the geometric bodies and surfaces may intersect.
      Regions are defined relative to the geometric bodies and surfaces
      in a **UNIT**. **HOLE**\ s provide a means of creating complex
      geometries in a **UNIT** and then inserting the **UNIT** into
      existing **UNIT**\ s. For complex geometries the use of
      **HOLE**\ s may decrease the CPU time required for the problem.

   2. In KENO V.a, each geometry region in a **UNIT** must completely
      enclose all geometry regions which precede it. Boundaries of the
      surfaces of the regions may be shared or tangent, but they must
      not intersect. The use of **HOLE**\ s in KENO V.a provides an
      exception to this complete enclosure rule. The use of **HOLE**\ s
      in KENO V.a will increase the CPU time required for the problem.

2. All geometrical surfaces must be describable in KENO V.a as spheres,
      hemispheres, cylinders, hemicylinders, cubes, cuboids, or as a set
      of quadratic equations in KENO-VI.

3. When specifying an **ARRAY**, each **UNIT** used in a cuboidal
      **ARRAY** must have a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as its outer region
      (this is the only option in KENO V.a); a hexprism as the outer
      boundary if it is a hexagonal, triangular, or shexagonal
      **ARRAY**; a rhexprism as the outer boundary if it is a rhexagonal
      **ARRAY**; and a dodecahedron as the outer boundary if it is a
      dodecahedral **ARRAY**. In addition, the outer boundary of a
      **UNIT** cannot be rotated or translated in KENO V.a.

4. When several **UNIT**\ s are used to describe an **ARRAY**, the
      adjacent faces of the **UNIT**\ s in contact with each other must
      be the same size and shape.

5. **UNIT**\ s are placed directly into regions using **HOLE**\ s. As
      many **HOLE**\ s as will fit without intersecting other
      **HOLE**\ s, nested **ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s, or the **UNIT**
      **BOUNDARY** can be placed in a **UNIT** without intersecting each
      other. In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s cannot intersect any of the
      regions within the **UNIT** in which they are placed. **HOLE**\ s
      are described in more detail in :ref:`8-1-3-6-1`, and nested
      **HOLE**\ s are described in :ref:`8-1-3-6-2`.

6. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be required to describe a complicated
      system. In KENO V.a, only one **ARRAY** may be placed directly
      into a **UNIT**. However, multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be placed in a
      **UNIT** by placing the **ARRAY**\ s in other **UNIT**\ s and
      placing those **UNIT**\ s in the original **UNIT** using
      **HOLE**\ s. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be placed directly into a
      **UNIT** in KENO-VI. These **UNIT**\ s may then be used to create
      other **ARRAY**\ s, or they may be placed in other **UNIT**\ s
      using **HOLE**\ s. **UNIT**\ s placed in **ARRAY**\ s or
      **HOLE**\ s that are contained in other **HOLE**\ s or
      **ARRAY**\ s are said to be nested. The nesting level of a
      **UNIT** is the number of **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s between the
      **ARRAY** or **HOLE** in the **GLOBAL UNIT** or **ARRAY** and the
      **UNIT**. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s are described in more detail in
      :ref:`8-1-3-6-3`.

The KENO V.a geometry package allows any applicable **shape** to be
enclosed by any other applicable **shape**, subject only to the complete
enclosure restriction. The KENO-VI geometry package allows any **shape**
describable using quadratic equations to be enclosed or intersected by
any other allowable **shape**. The implication of this type of
description is that the entire volume between two adjacent geometrical
surfaces contains only one mixture, **HOLE**, or **ARRAY**. A void is
specified by a mixture ID of zero. If **HOLE**\ s are present in the
volume between two surfaces, the volume of that region is reduced by the
**HOLE**\ ’s volume(s).

In KENO V.a geometry, if the problem requires several **UNIT**\ s to
describe its geometrical characteristics, each **UNIT** that is used in
an **ARRAY** must have a rectangular parallelepiped as its outer
surface. This restriction is relaxed in KENO-VI, where the outer surface
may be a rectangular parallelepiped, a hexagonal prism, a 90º rotated
hexagonal prism, or a dodecahedron, but all units placed in an array
must use the same shape as their outer **BOUNDARY**. In order to
describe the composite overall geometrical characteristics of the
problem, these **UNIT**\ s may be arranged in a rectangular **ARRAY**
for KENO V.a geometry, or in either a rectangular, hexagonal,
shexagaonal, rhexagonal, or dodecahedral **ARRAY** for KENO-VI geometry.
This is done by specifying the number of units in the X, Y, and
Z directions. If more than one **UNIT** is involved, data must be
entered to define the number assigned to the **ARRAY** and the placement
of the individual **UNIT**\ s in the **ARRAY**. The **ARRAY** number,
the number of **UNIT**\ s in the X, Y, and Z directions, and the
placement data are called *array data* (:ref:`8-1-2-5`).

In the KENO V.a geometry description, the surrounding regions of any
**shape** may be placed around an **ARRAY**, and they may consist of any
number of regions in any order subject to the complete enclosure
restriction. **ARRAY**\ s are positioned relative to the **UNIT ORIGIN**
by specifying the location of the most negative point in the array, i.e.
the most negative X, most negative Y, and most negative Z corner of the
**ARRAY**. In KENO-VI geometry, an **ARRAY** may be placed in a region
of any shape if the region boundary is contained within the **ARRAY** or
shares the **ARRAY** boundary and does not cut across nested
**ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s. In this case, only the section of the
**ARRAY** contained within the region is recognized by the problem.
**ARRAY**\ s are positioned relative to the **UNIT** **ORIGIN** by
placing the **ORIGIN** of a specified **UNIT** in the **ARRAY** at a
specified location in the **UNIT**.

To create a geometry mockup from a physical configuration, the user
should keep the restrictions mentioned earlier in mind. There may be
several ways of correctly describing the same physical configuration.
Careful analysis of the system can result in a simpler mockup and
shorter computer running time. A mockup with fewer geometry regions may
run faster than the same mockup with extraneous regions. The number of
**UNIT**\ s used can affect the running time, because a transformation
of coordinates must be made every time a history moves from one **UNIT**
into another. Thus, if the size of a **UNIT** is small relative to the
mean free path, a larger percentage of time is spent processing the
transformation of coordinates. Because all boundaries in a **UNIT** must
be checked for crossings, it may be more efficient to break up complex
**UNIT**\ s into several smaller, simpler **UNIT**\ s. The trade-off
involves the time required to process more boundary crossings vs the
time required to transform coordinate systems when **UNIT** boundaries
are crossed.

**Geometry dimensions:** The use of FIDO syntax may help simplify the
description of the geometry. For example, a 20 × 20 × 2.5 cm rectangular
parallelepiped would have been described as **CUBOID** 1 1 10.0 −10.0
10.0 −10.0 1.25 −1.25 in KENO V.a and **CUBOID** 1 10.0 –10.0 10.0 –10.0
1.25 –1.25 in KENO-VI. By using the P option (see Table 8.1.17), the
same rectangular parallelepiped could be described as **CUBOID** 1 1
4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO V.a and or **CUBOID** 1 4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO-VI,
where the last 6 entries describe the geometry. The P option simply
repeats the dimension following the P for the number of times stated
before the P, and it reverses the sign every time. Therefore, 6P8.0 is
equivalent to 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0.

**Geometry comments:** One comment can be entered for each **UNIT** in
the *geometry region data*. Similarly, one comment can be entered for
each **ARRAY** in the *array definition data*. A comment can be entered
using the keyword **COM**\ =. This is followed by a comment with a
maximum length of 132 characters. The comment must be preceded and
terminated by a delimiter character. Acceptable delimiters include “ , ‘
, \* , ^ , or !. One comment is allowed for each **UNIT** in the
*geometry region data*. If multiple comments are entered for a **UNIT**,
the last comment is used. The comment can be entered anywhere after the
**UNIT** number where a keyword is expected (:ref:`8-1-2-4`). See the
following example.

Some of the basics of KENO geometry are illustrated in the following examples:

EXAMPLE 1. Assume a stack of six cylindrical disks each measuring 5 cm
in radius and 2 cm thick. The bottom disk is composed of material 1, and
the next disk is composed of material 2, etc., alternating throughout
the stack. A square plate of material 3 that is 20 cm on a side and
2.5 cm thick is centered on top of the stack. This configuration is
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-12`.

.. _fig8-1-12:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig12.png
  :align: center
  :width: 400

  Stack of disks with a square top.

This problem can be described as a single **UNIT** problem, describing
the cylindrical portion first. In this instance, the origin has been
chosen at the center bottom of the bottom disk. The bottom disk is
defined by the first cylinder description, and the next disk is defined
by the difference between the first and second cylinder descriptions.
Since both disks have a radius of 5.0 and a −Z length of 0.0, the first
cylinder containing material 1 exists from Z = 0.0 to Z = 2.0, and the
second cylinder containing material 2 exists from Z = 2.0 to Z = 4.0.
When all the disks have been described, a void cuboid having the same X
and Y dimensions as the square plate and the same Z dimensions as the
stack of disks is defined. The square plate of material 3 is then
defined on top of the stack. Omission of the first cuboid description
would result in the stack of disks being encased in a solid cuboid of
material 3 instead of having a flat plate on top of the stack. The
geometry input is shown below.

An alternative description of the same example is given below. The
origin has been chosen at the center of the disk of material 1 nearest
the center of the stack. This disk of material 1 is defined by the first
cylinder description, and the disks of material 2 on either side of it
are defined by the second cylinder description. The top and bottom disks
of material 1 are defined by the third cylinder, and the top disk of
material 2 is defined by the last cylinder. The square plate is defined
by the two cuboids. This description is more efficient than the previous
one because there are fewer surfaces to check for crossings.

Example 1 can also be described as an **ARRAY**. Define three different
**UNIT** types. **UNIT** 1 will define a disk of material 1, **UNIT** 2
will define a disk of material 2, and **UNIT** 3 will define the square
plate of material 3. The origin of each **UNIT** is defined at the
center bottom of the disk or plate being described. As mentioned
earlier, only **UNIT**\ s with a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as their outer
boundary can be placed in a cuboidal **ARRAY**. The geometry input for
this arrangement is shown below.

Be aware that each **UNIT** in a geometry description can have its
origin defined independent of the other **UNIT**\ s. It would be correct
to use **UNIT**\ s 1 and 3 from data descriptions 3, and **UNIT** 2 from
data description 4. The *array data* would remain the same as data
description 3, Example 1. The user should define the origin of each unit
to be as convenient as possible for the chosen description. Care should
be taken when assigning coordinates to the **UNIT** used to **PLACE**
the **ARRAY** in its surrounding region.

Another method of describing Example 1 as a bare array is to define
**UNIT** 1 to be a disk of material 1 topped by a disk of material 2.
The origin has been chosen at the center bottom of the disk of
material 1. **UNIT** 2 is the square plate of material 3 with the origin
at the center of the **UNIT**. The **ARRAY** consists of three
**UNIT** 1s, topped by a **UNIT** 2, as shown below.

Example 1 can be described as a reflected **ARRAY** by treating the
square plate as a reflector in the positive Z direction. One means of
describing this situation is to define **UNIT**\ s 1 and 2 as in data
description 3, Example 1. The origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT** is defined
to be at the center of the **ARRAY**. The corresponding input geometry
is shown below.

The user could have chosen the origin of the **ARRAY** boundary to be at

description for the **GLOBAL UNIT** would be:

The reflector region at the top of the array can be added by using a
**CUBOID** or by using a **REPLICATE** description in KENO V.a. Recall
that there is no **REPLICATE** function in KENO-VI.

A simpler method of describing Example 1 as a reflected array is to
define only one unit as in data description 5, Example 1. The square
plate is treated as a reflector, as in data description 6, Example 1.

EXAMPLE 2. Assume that the stack of six disks in Example 1 is placed at
the center bottom of a cylindrical container composed of material 6
whose inside diameter is 16.0 cm. The bottom and sides of the container
are 0.25 cm thick, the top is open, and the total height of the
container is 18.25 cm. Assume the square plate of Example 1 is centered
on top of the container.

In the above description, the origin is defined to be at the center of
the disk of material 1 nearest the center of the stack. This disk is
defined by the first cylinder description. The disks of material 2 above
and below it are defined by the second cylinder description. The disks
of material 1 above and below them are defined by the third cylinder
description. The top disk of material 2 is defined by the fourth
cylinder description. The void interior of the container is defined by
the fifth cylinder description. The container is defined by the last
cylinder description. The first cuboid description is used to define a
void whose X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate and whose
Z dimensions are the same as the container. The last cuboid description
defines the square plate. Omission of the first cuboid description would
result in the container being encased in a solid cuboid of material 3.
Thus, both cuboids are necessary to properly define the square plate.

Example 2 can be described as a reflected **ARRAY**. One of the
descriptions uses only one **UNIT** and is similar to data
description 7, Example 1. This description is shown below.

In the above data description, the first two cylinder descriptions
define a disk of material 1 with a disk of material 2 directly on top of
it. A tight fitting void cuboid is placed around them so they can be
stacked three high to achieve the stack of disks shown in Example 1,
:numref:`fig8-1-12`. This array comprises the array portion of the geometry
region description. The origin of the array boundary, a tight fitting
cube or cuboid that encompasses the array, is defined by the **ARRAY**
description. Everything after the **ARRAY** record is considered part of
the reflector. The first cylinder after the **ARRAY** record defines the
void interior of the cylindrical container. The next cylinder defines
the walls of the container. The second-to-last cuboid defines a void
volume outside the container from its bottom to its top and having the
same X and Y dimensions as the square plate. The last cuboid defines the
square plate of material 3 that is sitting on top of the container.

Another method to describe Example 2 is as an array composed of units
that contain both the stack and container. This description requires a
minimum of four units to describe the problem. This configuration is
given below in data description 3, Example 2.

In the above description, **UNIT** 1 is the bottom of the cylindrical
container. The void **CUBOID** is only as tall as the bottom of the
container, and its X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate
on top of the container. If all the **UNIT**\ s in the **ARRAY** use
these same dimensions in the X and Y directions, the requirement that
adjacent faces of units in contact with each other must be the same size
and shape is satisfied. This **ARRAY** is stacked in the Z direction, so
all **UNIT**\ s must have the same overall dimensions in the X direction
and in the Y direction. **UNIT** 2 will be used in the **ARRAY** three
times to create the stack of disks. It contains a disk of material 1
topped by a disk of material 2. The portion of the container that
contains the disks and the cuboid that defines the outer boundaries of
the unit are included in **UNIT** 2. **UNIT** 3 describes the empty top
portion of the container and the square plate on top of it. The
Z dimensions of **UNIT** 3 were determined by subtracting three times
the total Z dimension of **UNIT** 2 from the inside height of the
container [18.0 − (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. This can also be determined from the
overall height of the container by subtracting off the bottom thickness
of the container and three times the height of **UNIT** 2 [18.25 − 0.25
− (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. The origin of **UNIT** 3 is located at the center of
this distance. For the KENO-VI input, a **GLOBAL UNIT** is also
provided, **UNIT** 4, containing the **ARRAY** built with **UNIT**\ s 1,
2, 3.

EXAMPLE 3. Refer to Example 1, :numref:`fig8-1-12`, and imagine a **HOLE**
1.5 cm in diameter is drilled along the centerline of the stack through
the disks and the square plate. In KENO V.a this **HOLE** would
eliminate the possibility of describing the system as a single unit
because the **HOLE** in the center of the alternating materials of the
stack cannot be described in a manner that allows each successive
geometry region to encompass the regions interior to it. Therefore, it
must be described as an **ARRAY**. The square plate on the top of the
disks is defined as a **UNIT** in the **ARRAY**. In the geometry
description given below, the square plate is defined in **UNIT** 3.
KENO-VI can easily describe this configuration as a single **UNIT**.

In data description 1, Example 3 above, KENO V.a input, **UNIT** 1
describes a disk of material 1 with a **HOLE** through its centerline.
The first **CYLINDER** defines the **HOLE**, the second defines the rest
of the disk, and the **CUBOID** defines the size of the **UNIT** to be
consistent with the square plate so they can be stacked together in an
**ARRAY**. **UNIT** 2 describes a disk of material 2 in similar fashion.
**UNIT** 3 describes the square plate of material 3 with a **HOLE**
through its center. The **CYLINDER** defines the **HOLE** and the
**CUBOID** defines the square plate. These three **UNIT**\ s are stacked
in the Z direction to achieve the composite system. This is represented
by **FILL** 1 2 2Q2 3. The 2Q2 repeats the two entries preceding the 2Q2
twice. Alternatively, this can be achieved by entering **FILL** 1 2 1 2
1 2 3 **END FILL**. The same **ARRAY** can also be achieved using the
**LOOP** option. An example of the data for this option is:

**LOOP** 1 6R1 1 5 2 2 6R1 2 6 2 3 6R1 7 7 1 **END LOOP**.

**UNIT** 1 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, and Z = 1,3,5 positions of the
**ARRAY** by entering 1 6R1 1 5 2. **UNIT** 2 is positioned at the X =
1, Y = 1 and Z = 2,4,6 positions in the **ARRAY** by entering 2 6R1 2 6
2. **UNIT** 3 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 7 position of the
**ARRAY** by entering 3 6R1 7 7 1. See Sect. 8.1.2.5 for additional
information regarding **ARRAY** specifications.

For the KENO-VI input, **UNIT** 1 contains the entire problem
description. The first **CYLINDER** describes the 1.5 cm diameter hole
through the stack. The next four **CYLINDER**\ s define the stack. The
sixth and seventh **CYLINDER**\ s describe the void and container. The
two **CUBOID**\ s describe the top plate and surrounding global region
of void. The **MEDIA** cards are used to place the materials in the
appropriate regions.

EXAMPLE 4. Assume two large cylinders that are 2.5 cm in radius and 5 cm
long are connected by a smaller cylinder that is 0.5 cm in radius and
10 cm long, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-13`. All three cylinders are composed of
material 1. By starting the geometry description in the small cylinder,
this system can be described as a single unit.

The origin is at the center of the small cylinder, which is described by
the first cylinder description. The second cylinder description defines
a void cylinder surrounding the small cylinder. Its radius is the same
as the large cylinders, and its height (length) coincides with that of
the small cylinder. The last cylinder description defines the large
cylinders on either end of the small cylinder. In KENO V.a, because this
problem does not specify otherwise, the length of the **CYLINDER**\ s is
assumed to coincide with the Z axis. In KENO-VI, because the problem was
created using **XCYLINDER**\ s, the long axes of the **CYLINDER**\ s
coincide with the X axis.

EXAMPLE 5. Assume two large cylinders with a center-to-center spacing of
15 cm, each having a radius of 2.5 cm and length of 5 cm, are connected
radially by a small cylinder having a radius of 1.5 cm, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-14`.

  Two large cylinders radially connected by a small cylinder.

This system cannot be described rigorously in KENO V.a geometry because
the intersection of the cylinders cannot be described. However, it can
be approximated two ways, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-15`. The top approximation
is described in data description 1, Example 5. The bottom approximation
is described in data description 2, Example 5, and data description 3,
Example 5. These may be poor approximations for criticality safety
calculations.

The above geometry description uses **ARRAY**\ s of **ARRAY**\ s (see
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3`) to describe the bottom approximation of :numref:`fig8-1-15`.
**UNIT** 1 defines a large **CYLINDER** that has a radius of 2.5 cm and
a height of 10 cm inside a close-fitting **CUBOID**. This is used in
both large **CYLINDER**\ s as the portion of the large **CYLINDER** that
exists above and below the region where the small **CYLINDER** joins it.
**UNIT** 5 is the spacing between the tops of the two large
**CYLINDER**\ s and the spacing between the bottoms of the two large
**CYLINDER**\ s. **ARRAY** 1 thus defines the bottom of the system:
two short **CYLINDER**\ s (**UNIT** 1s) separated by 10 cm (**UNIT** 5
is the separation). **UNIT** 6 contains **ARRAY** 1.

**UNIT** 2 is the left hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal
**CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 3 is the right hemicylinder that adjoins the
horizontal **CYLINDER**. **UNIT** 4 defines the horizontal **CYLINDER**.
**ARRAY** 2 contains **UNIT**\ s 2, 4, and 3 from left to right. This
defines the central portion of the system where the horizontal
**CYLINDER** adjoins the two hemicylinders. These hemicylinders are
larger than half **CYLINDER**\ s. **UNIT** 7 contains **ARRAY** 2. The
entire system is achieved by stacking a **UNIT** 6 above and below the
**UNIT** 7 as defined in **ARRAY** 3, the **GLOBAL ARRAY**.

The above geometry description uses **HOLE**\ s (see :ref:`8-1-3-6-1`) to
describe the bottom approximation of :numref:`fig8-1-15`. **UNIT** 1 defines a
large **CYLINDER** with a radius of 2.5 cm and a height of 1.0 cm.
**UNIT** 2 defines the same **CYLINDER** within a **CUBOID** that
extends from X = −2.5 to X = 17.5, from Y = −2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0
to Z = 1.0. The origin of the **CYLINDER** is at (0.0,0.0,0.0). Thus
**UNIT** 2 describes the top and bottom of the **CYLINDER** on the left.
**UNIT** 1 is positioned within this **CUBOID** as a **HOLE** with its
origin at (15.0,0.0,0.0) to describe the top and bottom of the
**CYLINDER** on the right. **UNIT** 3 is the left hemicylinder that
adjoins the horizontal **CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 4 is the right
hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal **CYLINDER**. **UNIT** 5
defines the horizontal **CYLINDER** with its origin at the center within
a **CUBOID** that extends from X = −10.0 to X = +10.0, Y = −2.5 to Y =
2.5, and Z = −1.5 to Z = 1.5. **UNIT** 3 is positioned to the left of
the horizontal **CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 4 is positioned to the right
of the horizontal **CYLINDER** by using **HOLE**\ s. The entire system
is achieved by stacking a **UNIT** 2 above and below **UNIT** 5 as shown
in the **ARRAY** data.

This same geometry description can be used with **UNIT** 2 redefined,
having its origin defined so that it extends from X = −10 to X = 10, Y =
−2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0 to Z = 1. In this instance, the geometry
data would be identical except for **UNIT** 2. This alternative
description of **UNIT** 2 is

The first and second **CYLINDER**\ s define the two large

  Two small cylinders joined axially by a large cylinder.

This problem is very similar to Example 4. It can be described as a
single **UNIT** in KENO-VI, but not in KENO V.a where it must be
described as an array. In KENO V.a, **UNIT** 1 defines the large
cylinder, and **UNIT** 2 defines the small cylinder. The origin of each
**UNIT** is at its center. The composite system consists of two
**UNIT** 2s and one **UNIT** 1 as shown below. In KENO-VI,
**CYLINDER** 1 defines the long thin cylinder, and **CYLINDER** 2
defines the short thick cylinder. The origin of each cylinder is at its
center. In both KENO V.a and KENO-VI, the centerline of the cylinders
lies along the Z axis.

In the KENO V.a input, the **ARRAY** boundary defines the origin of the
**REFLECTOR** to be at the center of the **ARRAY**. The 6*3.0 in the
**REFLECTOR** description repeats the 3.0 six times. The **REFLECTOR**
record is used to generate ten **REFLECTOR** regions, each of which is
3.0 cm thick, on all six faces of the **ARRAY**.

In the KENO-VI input, the basic **UNIT** used to construct the **ARRAY**
is defined in **UNIT** 1. The **ARRAY** is positioned in **UNIT** 2
(the **GLOBAL UNIT**) using the **ARRAY** card and the **PLACE** option.
The **ARRAY** is then surrounded by ten \ **REFLECTOR** regions, each
3.0 cm thick, on all sides.

The first bias **ID** is 2, so the last bias **ID** will be 11 if
10 regions are created. The biasing data block is necessary to apply
the desired weighting or biasing function to the reflector. The
biasing material ID is obtained from :numref:`tab8-1-20`. IDs, group
structure and incremental thickness for
weighting data available on the KENO  weighting library. If the
biasing data block is omitted from the problem description, the 10
reflector regions will not have a biasing function applied to them,
and the default value of the average weight will be used. This may
cause the problem to execute more slowly, and therefore require the
use of more computer time.

EXAMPLE 10. Assume the reflector in Example 9 is present only on both
X faces, both Y faces, and the negative Z face. The reflector is only
15.24 cm thick on these faces. The top of the array (positive Z face) is
unreflected.

In the KENO V.a input, the first **REFLECTOR** description generates
five regions around the **ARRAY**, each region being 3.0 cm thick in the
+X, −X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. This defines a total thickness of 15 cm of reflector
material on the appropriate faces. The second **REFLECTOR** description
generates the last 0.24 cm of material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total
reflector thickness is 15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the
top which has no reflector. Five reflector regions were generated by the
first **REFLECTOR** description, and one was generated by the second
**REFLECTOR** description; so, six biasing regions must be defined in
the biasing data. Thus, the beginning bias **ID** is 2, and the ending
bias ID is 7.

In the KENO-VI input, the first **CUBOID** in Unit 2 represents the
boundary for the **ARRAY**. The next four **CUBOID**\ s represent the
first four regions around the **ARRAY**, each region being 3.0 cm thick
in the +X, X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. A total thickness of 12 cm of reflector material is on the
appropriate faces. The last **CUBOID** represents the last 3.24 cm of
material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total reflector thickness is
15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the top which has no
reflector. The beginning bias ID is 2, and the ending bias ID is 6. The
last region could either be larger or smaller than the recommended
thickness to complete the reflector.

The biasing material **ID** and thickness per region are obtained from
:numref:`tab8-1-20`. The thickness per region should be very nearly the
thickness per region from the table to avoid over biasing in the
reflector. Partial increments at the outer region of a reflector are
exempt from this recommendation. If a biasing function is not to be
applied to a region generated by the **REFLECTOR** record, the thickness
per region can be any desired thickness and the biasing data block is
omitted.

EXAMPLE 11. Assume the array of Example 7 has the central unit of the
array replaced by a cylinder of material 4, 5 cm in radius and 10 cm
tall. Assume a 20 cm thick spherical reflector of material 3 (concrete)
is positioned so its inner radius is 65 cm from the center of the array.
The minimum inner radius of a spherical reflector for this array is
62.25 cm (:math:`\sqrt{55^{2} + 25^{2} + 15^{2} }`). If the inner radius is smaller than this, the problem
cannot be described using KENO V.a geometry.

**UNIT** 1 describes the **SPHERE** and spacing used in the **ARRAY**.
**UNIT** 2 defines the **CYLINDER** located at the center of the
**ARRAY**. In KENO V.a, the **ARRAY** record defines the origin of the
reflector to be at the center of the **ARRAY**, while in KENO-VI it
defines the origin of the **ARRAY** to be at the center of the **GLOBAL
UNIT**. The first **SPHERE** in the **GLOBAL UNIT** defines the inner
radius of the reflector. The next four **SPHERE** and four **MEDIA**
records of the KENO-VI input and the **REPLICATE** record of the KENO
V.a input will generate four spherical regions of material 3, each
5.0 cm thick. The data for the **BIAS** block is generated in a similar
manner to previous examples, except that concrete (ID=301) is used. The
recommended reflector thickness is 5 cm; this thickness is incorporated
explicitly in the KENO-VI model and with 4 repetitions of the 5 cm thick
reflector via **REPLICATE** in the KENO V.a model. The first 10 entries
following the word **LOOP** fills the 11 × 5 × 3 **ARRAY** with
**UNIT**\ s 1. The next 10 entries position **UNIT** 2 at the center of
the **ARRAY** (X = 6, Y = 3, and Z = 2), replacing the **UNIT** 1 that
had been placed there by the first 10 entries.

EXAMPLE 12. Assume a data profile such as fission densities is desired
in a cylinder at 0.5 cm intervals in the radial direction and 1.5 cm
intervals axially. The cylinder is composed of material 1 and has a
radius of 5 cm and a height of 15 cm. The **REPLICATE** or **REFLECTOR**
description can be used to generate these regions in KENO V.a. A biasing
data block is not entered because default biasing is desired throughout
the cylinder.

Use of holes in the geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`8-1-3-6` tells how each KENO V.a geometry region in a **UNIT**
must completely enclose all previously described regions in that
**UNIT** and how KENO-VI geometry allows regions in a **UNIT** to
intersect, thus eliminating the need for **HOLE**\ s. **HOLE**\ s can be
used to circumvent the complete enclosure restriction in KENO V.a to
some degree. In KENO-VI, they can be useful in simplifying the input of
a problem and decreasing the total CPU time needed for a problem.
A \ **HOLE** is a means of placing an entire **UNIT** within a geometry
region. A separate **HOLE** description is required for every location
in a geometry region where a **UNIT** is to be placed. The information
contained in a **HOLE** description is (1) the keyword **HOLE**, (2) the
**UNIT** number of the **UNIT** to be placed, and (3) any modification
data needed to correctly position and rotate (in KENO-VI) the specified
**UNIT** within the containing **UNIT**. In KENO V.a, a **HOLE** is
placed inside the geometry region that precedes it. This excludes
**HOLE**\ s ... (i.e., if a **CUBE** geometry region is followed by four
**HOLE** descriptions, all four **HOLE**\ s are located within the
**CUBE**). In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s are subject to the restriction that
they cannot intersect any other geometry region. **HOLE**\ s can be
nested to any depth (see :ref:`8-1-3-6-2`). It is not advisable to use
**HOLE**\ s tangent to other **HOLE**\ s or geometry, because round-off
error may cause them to overlap. It is not uncommon for a problem that
runs on one type of computer to fail on another type using the same
data. Therefore, it is recommended that tangency and boundaries shared
with **HOLE**\ s be avoided. This may be accomplished by separating the
otherwise collocated or tangent surfaces by a very small (i.e.,
10\ :sup:`-6` cm) distance.

In KENO V.a, tracking in regions that contain holes is less efficient
than tracking in regions that do not contain holes. Therefore, holes
should be used only when the system cannot be easily described by
conventional methods. One example of the use of holes is shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-19`, representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus.

In KENO-VI, tracking in regions that contain **HOLE**\ s can be more
efficient than tracking in regions that do not contain **HOLE**\ s
because every region boundary in a **UNIT** must be checked for a
crossing whenever a crossing is possible. Putting small but complex
geometries in a hole will lessen the number of boundaries that need to
be checked for possible crossings. However, the indiscriminate use of
holes is not advised since the particle must change coordinate systems
every time a hole is entered or exited. Therefore, holes should be used
carefully and only when the system can be simplified significantly by
their use.

EXAMPLE 15. One example of a unit that requires holes in KENO V.a is
better described not using holes in KENO-VI as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-19`,
representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus. The large rods are
1.4 cm in radius and composed of mixture 3. The small rods are 0.6 cm
in radius and composed of mixture 1. The inside radius of the annulus
is 3.6 cm, and the outside radius is 3.8 cm. The annulus is made of
mixture 2. The rods and annulus are both 30 cm long. The annulus is
centered in a cuboid having an 8 cm\ :sup:`2` cross section and a
length of 32 cm. The black and gray areas in
:numref:`fig8-1-19` are void.

The first **HOLE** description in the KENO V.a input represents the
bottom large rod. It takes **UNIT** 2 and places its **ORIGIN** at
(0.0,−2.0,0.0) relative to the **ORIGIN** of **UNIT** 3. The second
**HOLE** description represents the small rod to the right of the large
rod just discussed. It places the origin of **UNIT** 1 at (2.0,−2.0,0.0)
in **UNIT** 3. The third **HOLE** description represents the large rod
to the right. It places the origin of **UNIT** 2 at (2.0,0.0,0.0) in
**UNIT** 3. This procedure is repeated in a counterclockwise direction
until all eight rods have been placed within the region that defines the
inner surface of the annulus. The **CYLINDER** that defines the outer
surface of the annulus is described after all the **HOLE**\ s for the
previous region have been placed. Then the outer **CUBOID** is
described. This example illustrates that a **UNIT** that is to be placed
using a **HOLE** description need not have a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as
its last region. Note that including the central rod directly in
**UNIT** 3 reduces the CPU time required for transport compared to the
case of all 9 rods being inserted as **HOLE**\ s. It is also important
that the 9 **HOLE**\ s are inserted *after* the void cylinder into which
they are inserted. Entering the **HOLE**\ s in any other position in the
input would generated region intersection errors. The order of the HOLE
records in any given region is not important, as they can be
interchanged with each other randomly. However, they must always appear
immediately after the region in which they are placed.

The KENO-VI input does not need to use **HOLE**\ s. The first
**CYLINDER** description in this case represents the middle small rod.
The next four **CYLINDER** records describe the four remaining small
rods surrounding the middle rod. The **ORIGIN** attribute is used to
shift the origin of each **CYLINDER** to the appropriate location. The
following four **CYLINDER** records represent the four large rods.
Again, the **ORIGIN** attribute is used to shift the **ORIGIN** of each
**CYLINDER** to the appropriate location. Only the nonzero dimensions
need to be entered in the **ORIGIN** data. The tenth **CYLINDER** record
is the void in the annulus that contains the rods. The last **CYLINDER**
record defines the outer surface of the annulus. Finally, the **CUBOID**
record describes the surrounding **UNIT** boundary.


In KENO-VI, holes may not extend across any array outer boundary, may
not intersect with other holes, and may not cross the host UNIT outer
boundary. Thus a hole may be placed so that it crosses several regions
within an array. The hole description replaces the unit description
within the hole domain. Since the holes are placed using the host UNIT
coordinate system, the location of the hole record in the unit
definition is not relevant.

An array of the arrangement shown in :numref:`fig8-1-19` can be easily described
by altering the array description data. For example, a 5 × 3 × 2 array
of these shapes with a center-to-center spacing of 8 cm in X and Y and
32 cm in Z can be achieved by using the following array data:

::

	READ ARRAY  NUX=5 NUY=3 NUZ=2  FILL F3  END FILL  END ARRAY

or

::

	READ ARRAY  NUX=5 NUY=3 NUZ=2  FILL 30*3  END FILL  END ARRAY

Nesting holes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section illustrates how holes are nested. Holes can be nested to
any level. Consider the configuration illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-19` and
replace the large rods with a complicated geometric arrangement. The
resulting Fig. is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-20`. :numref:`fig8-1-21` shows the
complicated geometric arrangement that replaced the large rods of
:numref:`fig8-1-19`. :numref:`fig8-1-22` shows a component of the arrangement shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-20`.

EXAMPLE 16. There is no predetermined preferred method to create a
geometry mockup for a given physical system. The user should determine
the most convenient order. To describe the configuration shown in Fig.
8.1.20 using nested **HOLE**\ s, it is likely most convenient to start
the geometry mockup at the deepest nesting level, as shown in
Fig. 8.1.22. The small **CYLINDER**\ s are composed of mixture 1, and
they are each 0.1 cm in radius and 30 cm long. There are five small
**CYLINDER**\ s used in Fig. 8.1.22. Their centers are located at
(0,0,0) for the central one, at (0,−0.4,0) for the bottom one, at
(0.4,0,0) for the right one, at (0,0.4,0) for the top one, and at
(−0.4,0,0) for the left one. The rectangular parallelepipeds
(**CUBOID**\ s) are composed of mixture 2. Each one is 30 cm long and
0.1 cm by 0.2 cm in cross section. The large **CYLINDER** containing the
configuration is composed of mixture 3, is 30 cm long and has a radius
of 0.5 cm.

A possible geometry mockup for this system is described as follows in
KENO V.a:

   (1) define a small cylinder to be **UNIT** 1,

   (2) define a small **CUBOID** with its length in the X direction to
   be **UNIT** 2,

   (3) define a small **CUBOID** with its length in the Y direction to
   be **UNIT** 3,

   (4) define **UNIT** 4 to be the large cylinder and place the
   **CYLINDER**\ s and **CUBOID**\ s in it using **HOLE**\ s.

In :numref:`fig8-1-21`, the large plain cylinders are composed of mixture 1 and
are 0.5 cm in radius and 30 cm long. The cylindrical component of
**UNIT** 4 for KENO V.a or **UNIT** 1 for KENO-VI is the same size: an
outer radius of 0.5 cm and a length of 30 cm. The small cylinders
located in the interstices between the large cylinders are composed of
mixture 2, are 0.2 cm in radius, and are 30 cm long. The annulus is
composed of mixture 4, has a 1.3 cm inside radius and a 1.4 cm outer
radius. The volume between the inner cylinders is void. The large
cylinders each have a radius of 0.5 cm and are tangent. Therefore, their
origins are offset from the origin of the **UNIT** by 0.707107. This is
from X\ :sup:`2` + Y\ :sup:`2` = 1.0, where X and Y are equal.

For KENO V.a, define **UNIT** 5 to be the large plain cylinder,
**UNIT** 6 to be the small cylinder, and **UNIT** 7 as the annulus that
contains the cylinders. Its origin is at its center. The geometry mockup
for this portion of the problem follows:

Multiple arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EXAMPLE 17. :ref:`8-1-3-6` demonstrates how **UNIT**\ s are composed of
geometry regions and how these **UNIT**\ s can be stacked in an
**ARRAY**. This same procedure can be extended to create multiple
**ARRAY**\ s. Furthermore, **ARRAY**\ s can be used as building blocks
within other **ARRAY**\ s.

Consider Sample Problem 19 from Appendix C. This problem is a critical
experiment consisting of a composite array :cite:`thomas_critical_1973,thomas_critical_1964` of four
highly enriched uranium metal cylinders and four cylindrical Plexiglas
containers filled with uranyl nitrate solution. A photograph of the
experiment is given in :numref:`fig9-1c-3`. The coordinate system is defined to
be Z up the page, Y across the page, and X out of the page.

The Plexiglas containers have an inside radius of 9.525 cm and an
outside radius of 10.16 cm. The inside height is 17.78 cm, and the
outside height is 19.05 cm. Four of these containers are stacked with a
center-to-center spacing of 21.75 cm in the Y direction and 20.48 cm in
the Z direction (vertical). This arrangement of four Plexiglas
containers can be described as follows: mixture 2 is the uranyl nitrate
and mixture 3 is Plexiglas, so the Plexiglas container with its
appropriate spacing **CUBOID** can be described as **UNIT** 1. This
considers the **ARRAY** to be bare and suspended with no supports.

  BOUNDARY  3

The **ARRAY** of four Plexiglas containers can be described as
**ARRAY** 1 in the array data as follows:

   **ARA**\ =1 **NUX**\ =1 **NUY**\ =2 **NUZ**\ =2 **FILL** F1 **END
   FILL**

The four metal cylinders, comprised of mixture 1, each have a radius of
5.748 cm and are 10.765 cm tall. They have a center-to-center spacing of
13.18 cm in the Y direction and 12.45 cm in the Z direction (vertical).
Thus, one of the metal cylinders with its appropriate spacing **CUBOID**
can be described as **UNIT** 2. This **ARRAY** is also considered to be
bare and unsupported.

Now two **ARRAY**\ s have been described. The overall dimensions of the
**ARRAY** of Plexiglas containers are 21.75 cm in X, 43.5 cm in Y, and
40.96 cm in Z. The overall dimensions of the **ARRAY** of metal
cylinders are 13.18 cm in X, 26.36 cm in Y, and 24.9 cm in Z.

In order to describe the composite **ARRAY**, these two **ARRAY**\ s
must be positioned within **UNIT**\ s and stacked together into one
**ARRAY**. In order for them to be stacked into one **ARRAY**, the
adjacent faces must match. This is accomplished by defining a **UNIT** 3
which contains **ARRAY** 1, the **ARRAY** of Plexiglas solution
containers. The overall dimensions of this **UNIT** are 21.75 cm in X,
43.5 cm in Y, and 40.96 cm in Z. These dimensions are calculated by the
code and need not be specified. **UNIT** 3 is defined as follows:

KENO V.a:

::

  UNIT 3
  ARRAY 1  3*0.0

KENO-VI:

::

  UNIT 3
  CUBOID  1 2P10.875 2P21.75 2P20.48
  ARRAY 1 1 PLACE 1 1 1 0.0 -10.875 -10.24
  BOUNDARY  1

The **ARRAY** of metal cylinders will be defined to be **UNIT** 4.
However, this **ARRAY** is 17.14 cm smaller in the Y and 16.06 cm
smaller in the Z dimensions than the **ARRAY** of Plexiglas **UNIT**\ s.
Therefore, a void region must be placed around the **ARRAY** in those
directions so **UNIT** 4 and **UNIT** 3 will be the same size in Y and
Z.

KENO V.a:

::

  UNIT 4
  ARRAY  2  3*0.0
  REPLICATE  0 1 2*0.0  2*8.57  2*8.03  1

  ARRAY  2  1 PLACE 1 1 1 0.0 -6.59 -6.225
  MEDIA 0 1 2 -1
  BOUNDARY 2

Now that **UNIT** 3 and **UNIT** 4 have been defined, they must be
placed in the global or universe **ARRAY** to define the physical
arrangement of the eight pieces. This procedure is implemented via a
**GLOBAL** **ARRAY** in KENO V.a, while KENO-VI uses a **GLOBAL UNIT** 3
as follows:


KENO V.a:

The description of **ARRAY** 3 in KENO-VI is identical to that shown for
KENO V.a.

This completes the geometry description for the problem. The complete

EXAMPLE 18. Consider a storage array of highly enriched uranium buttons,
each 1 in. tall and 4 in. in diameter. These buttons are stored on
stainless steel shelves with a center-to-center spacing of 60.96 cm
(2 ft) between them in the Y direction, and only one button on each
shelf in the X direction. The shelves are 0.635 cm
(:sup:`1`/:sub:`4` in.) thick (Z dimension), 45.72 cm (18 in.) wide (X
dimension), 609.6 cm (20 ft) long (Y dimension), and are 45.72 cm
(18 in.) from the top of a shelf to the bottom of the shelf above it.
Each rack of storage shelves is four shelves high, with the first shelf
being 15.24 cm (6 in.) above the floor. The storage room is 586.56 cm
(19.5 ft) in the X direction by 1293.44 cm (43 ft) in the Y direction
with 365.76 cm (12 ft. ) ceilings in the Z direction. The walls,
ceiling, and floor are composed of concrete, 30.48 cm (1 ft) thick. All
the aisles between the storage racks are 91.44 cm (3 ft) wide. The racks
are arranged with their length in the Y direction and an aisle between
them. The arrays of racks are arranged with two in the Y direction and
five in the X direction. Mixture 1 is the uranium metal, mixture 2 is
the stainless steel, and mixture 3 is the concrete.

The metal button and its center-to-center spacing are described first.
The void vertical spacing has arbitrarily been chosen to extend from the
bottom of the button to the next shelf above the button. The shelf of
stainless steel is described under the button.

  Entire storage array in the room.

The complete input for this room is given below: The plots for this
problem must be quite large in order to see all the detail because the
array is sparse and the shelves are thin. Therefore, the plots for this
system are not included as Fig.s. The user can generate the plots if it
is desirable to see them. The nuclide IDs used in this problem are for
the 16-group Hansen-Roach working format library, which is no longer
distributed with SCALE.

Arrays and holes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`8-1-3-6-1` and :ref:`8-1-3-6-2` describe the use of **HOLE**\ s, and
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3` describes multiple **ARRAY**\ s and **ARRAY**\ s of
**ARRAY**\ s. **HOLE**\ s can be used to place **ARRAY**\ s at locations
in other **UNIT**\ s. This section contains examples to illustrate the
combined use of **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 19. A SIMPLE CASK


This example consists of cylindrical mild steel container with an inside
radius of 4.15 cm and a radial wall thickness of 0.45 cm. The thickness
of the ends of the container is 1.27 cm, and the inside height is
10.1 cm. Highly enriched uranium rods 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm long
are banded together into square bundles of four. These bundles are then
positioned in the mild steel container as shown in Fig. 8.1.28. The rods
sit on the floor of the container and have a 0.1 cm gap between their
tops and the top of the container.

To generate the geometry description for this system, **UNIT** 1 is
defined as one uranium rod and its associated square-pitch close-packed
spacing region.

four bundles of rods.

**ARRAY** 2 is defined to be a bundle of four rods.

   FILL**

**ARRAY** 2 is placed in **UNIT** 2. This defines the outer boundaries
of an imaginary **CUBOID** that contains the **ARRAY**. It is convenient
to have the origin of the **ARRAY** at its center, so the most negative
point of the array will be (−1, −1,−5).

  UNIT 2
  ARRAY 2  -1.0 -1.0 -5.0

An **ARRAY** record is used to place **ARRAY** 1 in the **GLOBAL UNIT**.
Then the cylindrical container is described around it and **HOLE**\ s
are used to place the four outer bundles around the central **ARRAY**.

**ARRAY** 1 is placed in **UNIT** 3. The first **CYLINDER** card defines
the **ARRAY** **BOUNDARY**. Everything external to this boundary is not
considered part of the problem. The positions in the **ARRAY** that do
not contain rods are filled with cuboids consisting of void. The
**ARRAY** boundary must either coincide with the outer boundary of the
**ARRAY** or be contained within the **ARRAY**. An exterior void region
is placed around the array boundary to coincide with the size of the
interior radius of the container. The 10 × 10 **ARRAY** with the
**ARRAY** boundary is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-29`.

The **UNIT** containing the **ARRAY** is now placed within the global
unit using a **HOLE** content record. The location of the **HOLE** is
determined using **ORIGIN** data to match the origin of the **UNIT** in
the **HOLE** with an X, Y, Z position in the surrounding **UNIT**. In
this problem, the origin of the **UNIT** must be at position (0,0,0).
Since only nonzero data must be entered, **ORIGIN** data are not needed
for this problem. The boundary region consists of the steel container.

The overall problem description is shown below. Two of the color plots
used for verification of this mockup are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-30` and
:numref:`fig8-1-31`. The black outside border of the two color plots indicates
volume outside the global unit. The plot can be extended just outside
the global unit boundary to ensure that the entire problem is included
in the plot. This results in a black area surrounding the actual
problem.

A typical PWR shipping cask is illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-32`. The interior
and exterior shell of the cask is carbon steel (mixture 7), and a
depleted uranium gamma shield (mixture 6) is present in the annulus
between the steel layers. The shipping cask contains seven PWR fuel
assemblies. Each assembly is a 17 × 17 **ARRAY** of fuel rods with water
holes. Each assembly is contained in a stainless steel (mixture 5) box.
Each fuel rod is composed of 4% enriched UO\ :sub:`2` (mixture 1) clad
with Zircaloy (mixture 2). Rods of B\ :sub:`4`\ C clad (mixture 4) with
stainless steel are positioned between the fuel assemblies. The entire
cask is filled with water (mixture 3).

The next step is to create the central array of three fuel assemblies
with B\ :sub:`4`\ C rods between them. In KENO V.a, this is done by
stacking fuel assemblies in storage cells (**UNIT** 7) and
B\ :sub:`4`\ C rod arrays (**UNIT** 8) into an array (**ARRAY** 3) and
placing it in a **UNIT** (**UNIT** 9). In KENO-VI description, **UNIT**
7 (fuel assembly in storage cell) and the array of B\ :sub:`4`\ C rods
(**ARRAY** 2) are directly placed into a **UNIT** (**UNIT** 8). The

In KENO V.a, **UNIT** 13 is simply a cylindrical lid that fits on top of
the shipping cask. It is described relative to the origin of the
shipping cask and is made of depleted uranium.

  UNIT 13
  CYLINDER  6 1 47.625 457.2 449.58

All necessary subassemblies that make up the shipping cask have been
built. The shipping cask is completed by specifying the origin of the
central section (**ARRAY** 6 in KENO V.a) (see :numref:`fig8-1-39`) to be at the
center of the array in X and Y and the bottom of the array in the Z
direction. A cylinder of water defining the interior of the shipping
cask is described around the array. In the KENO V.a geometry, a **HOLE**
is used to place **UNIT** 12 (:numref:`fig8-1-40`) below the array, and a second
HOLE is used to place another **UNIT** 12 above the array. In the
KENO-VI geometry, **UNIT** 9 is placed as a **HOLE** above and below the
central array. Then a cylinder of steel is placed around the water,
which is in turn encased by depleted uranium. The depleted uranium is
then contained in the outer steel cylinder of the shipping cask. In KENO
V.a description, a third **HOLE** is used to place the depleted uranium
lid (**UNIT** 13) on the shipping cask. This completes the shipping cask
description of :numref:`fig8-1-32`

The geometry data for this shipping cask are shown below. The plot data
have been included for verification of the geometry description.
However, the plot generated by this data is quite large and is therefore
not included in this document.

Triangular pitched arrays in KENO-VI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 21.

Triangular pitched **ARRAY**\ s can be described in KENO-VI
by defining the **UNIT**\ s that make up the **ARRAY** as **HEXPRISM**
and in the array data block setting **TYP**\ =TRIANGULAR, HEXAGONAL,
SHEXAGONAL, or RHEXAGONAL. This includes close-packed triangular pitched
arrays. Since the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by stacking hexprisms,
care must be taken to ensure that the **ARRAY** boundary is completely
enclosed within the stacked **UNIT**. Below is an example of a
triangular pitched **ARRAY**.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the **HEXPRISM**\ s that make up
the **ARRAY**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel cell stacked in a triangular
pitched or hexagonal lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to
fill in the **ARRAY** so the array boundary is contained within the
stacked **UNIT**\ s. Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2
contains void. :numref:`fig8-1-41` shows an X-Y cross section schematic of
**UNIT**\ s 1 and 2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY** **BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated triangular
pitched assembly of 7 cells. Unrotated triangular or hexagonal pitched
arrays can be set up in two array configurations. The first
configuration, selected using the **TYP**\ = followed by keyword
**HEXAGONAL** or **TRIANGULAR**, stacks the **UNIT**\ s so that the
faces perpendicular to the X axis meet. Each consecutive row in the Y
direction begins ½ of the face-to-face dimension farther over in the
positive X direction than in the previous row. The second configuration,
selected using the **TYP**\ = followed by keyword **SHEXAGONAL**, also
stacks the **UNIT**\ s so that the faces perpendicular to the X axis
meet. However, for this type of **ARRAY**, the odd numbered rows in the
Y direction (1, 3, 5, etc.) begin at the left edge of the **ARRAY**, and
the even numbered rows in the Y direction (2, 4, 6, etc.) begin ½ of the
face-to-face dimension to the right of the left edge of the **ARRAY**.
:numref:`fig8-1-42` and :numref:`fig8-1-43` show X-Y cross section schematics of the
assembly for the two different unrotated hexagonal **ARRAY** types.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 21a.

Another hexagonal **ARRAY** type involves stacking rotated hexprisms,
which are hexprisms rotated 30°/ 90º so that the flat faces
perpendicular to the Y axis now meet. Rotated hexagonal arrays are
specified by setting **TYP**\ =\ **RHEXAGONAL** in the array data block.
Because the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by stacking hexprisms, care
must be taken to ensure the array boundary is completely enclosed within
the stacked **UNIT**. Below is an example of a rotated hexagonal pitched
**ARRAY**.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the rotated hexprisms that make up
the **ARRAY**. They are specified using the geometry keyword
**RHEXPRISM**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel cell that is stacked in a rotated
hexagonal lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to fill in the
**ARRAY** so that the **ARRAY BOUNDARY** is contained within the stacked
**UNIT**\ s. Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2 contains
void. :numref:`fig8-1-45` shows an X-Y cross section schematic of **UNIT**\ s 1
and 2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated rotated hexagonal
pitched assembly of 7 cells. The rotated hexagonal array type is
specified in the array data block using **TYP**\ = with the keyword
**RHEXAGONAL**. This **ARRAY** type stacks the **UNIT**\ s so the faces
perpendicular to the Y axis meet. In the odd numbered columns (i.e., 1,
3, 5, etc.), the **UNIT**\ s are stacked so the columns begin at the
lower edge of the array and in the even numbered columns (i.e., 2, 4, 6,
etc.), the **UNIT**\ s are stacked so the columns begin ½ of the
face-to-face dimension above the lower edge of the **ARRAY**.

Triangular pitched Arrays in KENO V.a
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Triangular pitched arrays can be described in KENO V.a geometry by
properly defining the basic unit from which the array can be built. This
includes close-packed triangular pitched arrays. Two geometry
configurations are described below.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1. Bare Triangular pitched Array.

:numref:`fig8-1-48` illustrates a small close-packed triangular pitched
**ARRAY**. Each rod in the **ARRAY** has a radius of 2.0 cm, and the
pitch of the **ARRAY** is 4 cm. To create this **ARRAY**, describe five
units as defined in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

Assume the rods described in the **ARRAY** are each 2.0 cm in radius and
100 cm tall. The rods are composed of mixture 1. The geometry
descriptions for the first four **UNIT**\ s are given below.

::

  UNIT 1
  ZHEMICYL-Y 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 2
  ZHEMICYL+Y 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 3
  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  :align: center
  :width: 400

  Units used to describe a bare triangular pitched ARRAY.

To describe **UNIT** 5, the origin of the **UNIT** is defined to be at
its center. One of the hemicylinders is built into the box, and the
other three are added as holes. In this example, the +X hemicylinder is
built into the box, and the other hemicylinders are inserted as holes.
(Because the +X hemicylinder is built into **UNIT** 5, **UNIT** 4 is not
used in the problem.) The half dimension of the box in the X dimension
is equal to the radius, 2.0 cm. The half dimension of the box in the
Y direction is :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}` times the pitch (0.866025 \* 4.0) or 3.46411 cm.
**UNIT** 5 is described below.

::

  UNIT 5
  ZHEMICYL+X  1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0 ORIGIN -2.0 0.0
  CUBOID  0 1 2P2.0 2P3.46411 2P50.0
  HOLE 1 0.0  3.46411	0.0
  HOLE 2 0.0 -3.46411	0.0
  HOLE 3 2.0         	0.0

In the description of **UNIT** 5, the **ZHEMICYL+X** places the
hemicylinder at the left of the box. **HOLE** 1 places the top
hemicylinder, **HOLE** 2 places the bottom hemicylinder, and **HOLE** 3
places the hemicylinder at the right of the box.

Next, a **UNIT** 6 is defined that can be used to complete the lower rod
of **UNIT** 5. A **UNIT** 7 is defined that can be used to complete the
upper rod of **UNIT** 5. **UNIT** 8 is defined to complete the left rod
of **UNIT** 5, and **UNIT** 9 is defined to complete the right rod of
**UNIT** 5. **UNIT** 10 is defined to complete the corners of the
overall **ARRAY**. The input data for these **UNIT**\ s are given below
and are illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-50`.

The bottom row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data entries
10 4R6 10. The second row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data
entries 8 4R5 9. The third row is filled by repeating the previous six
entries (1Q6). It could also have been described by entering 8 4R5 9.
The top row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data entries 10 4R7 10.

:numref:`fig8-1-52` illustrates a close-packed triangular pitched **ARRAY** in a
cylinder. This array may be described by defining five basic units that
are the same as those of Example 1 shown in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

To describe **UNIT** 5, the origin of the **UNIT** to be at its center
is defined. One of the hemicylinders is built into the box, and the
other three are added as **HOLE**\ s. In this example, the
+X hemicylinder is built into the box, and the other hemicylinders are
inserted as **HOLE**\ s. The half dimension of the box in the
X dimension is equal to the radius, 2.0 cm. The half dimension of the
box in the Y direction is :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}` times the pitch (0.866025 * 4.0) or
3.46411 cm. **UNIT** 5 is described below.

  HOLE 2  0.0 -3.46411 0.0
  HOLE 3  2.0  0.0     0.0

In the description of **UNIT** 5, the **ZHEMICYL+X** places the
hemicylinder at the left of the box. **HOLE** 1 places the top
hemicylinder, **HOLE** 2 places the bottom hemicylinder, and **HOLE** 3
places the hemicylinder at the right of the box.

To describe the base **ARRAY** of the problem, **UNIT**\ s 5 is stacked
in a 4 × 2 × 1 array as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The input data for the
**ARRAY** are the following:

::

  ARA=1 NUX=4 NUY=2 NUZ=1  FILL F5 END FILL

.. _fig8-1-53:

  4 × 2 × 1 array to be placed within a cylinder.

Next, the **ARRAY** is placed within the cylinder. This is done by
placing the **ARRAY** in a **UNIT**, defined here to be **UNIT** 6. The
origin of the cylinder has been defined to be at the center of the
**ARRAY**. The resulting geometry is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-54`.

  CYLINDER 0 1 12.4  2P50.0
  CYLINDER 2 1 12.65 2P50.0

Next, the hemicylinders necessary to complete all of the half cylinders
remaining in :numref:`fig8-1-54` are added. This is done by placing four
**UNIT**\ s 1 at the appropriate positions along the bottom of the
**ARRAY**, four **UNIT**\ s 2 at the top of the **ARRAY**, two
**UNIT**\ s 3 at the left of the **ARRAY**, and two **UNIT**\ s 4 at the
right of the **ARRAY**. The input data are shown below, and the
resulting configuration is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-55`. In **UNIT** 6, the
first **HOLE** 1 places a **UNIT** 1 under the lower left **UNIT** of
the **ARRAY**. The second **HOLE** 1 places a **UNIT** 1 under the next
**ARRAY** **UNIT** to the right of the first one. This procedure is
repeated for the next two lower **ARRAY** **UNIT**\ s, thus completing
the lower row of cylinders. Similarly, the first **HOLE** 2 places a
**UNIT** 2 above the upper left **UNIT** of the **ARRAY**. The second
**HOLE** 2 places a **UNIT** 1 to the right of the first one, etc.,
until the four cylinders at the top of the **ARRAY** are completed. The
first **HOLE** 3 places a **UNIT** 3 at the lower left side of the
**ARRAY** to complete that rod. The second **HOLE** 3 completes the rod
above it. The first **HOLE** 4 completes the lower rod on the right side
of the **ARRAY**. The second **HOLE** 4 completes the rod above it. The
geometry data listed below result in the configuration shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-55`.

To complete the desired configuration, a cylinder is defined, **UNIT**
7, and it is placed at the four appropriate positions as shown below.
The first **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder of **UNIT** 7 at the left of
the **ARRAY**, the second **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the top of
the **ARRAY**, the third **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the right of
the **ARRAY**, and the fourth **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the
bottom of the **ARRAY**. The completed configuration is shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-56`. It is not necessary for **UNIT** 7 to precede **UNIT** 6.
It is allowable to place **UNIT** 7 after **UNIT** 6 in the input data.
Because the final configuration is defined in **UNIT** 6, it must be
designated as the **GLOBAL UNIT**. The total geometry input for this
example is listed below.

Consider the triangular pitched **ARRAY** shown in :numref:`fig8-1-52`. Another
method of describing this configuration is given below. Four basic
**UNIT**\ s are defined, as listed below. These are the same **UNIT**\ s
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

**UNIT** 5 is the same as previously defined in Example 2a, and pictured
in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

::

  UNIT 5
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0 ORIGIN -2.0 0.0

  HOLE 2  0.0 -3.46411 0.0
  HOLE 3  2.0  0.0     0.0

To describe the basic array for the problem, **UNIT**\ s 5 is stacked in
a 4 × 2 × 1 as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The input data for the **ARRAY**
are the following:

::

  ARA=1 NUX=4 NUY=2 NUZ=1  FILL F5 END FILL

Next, the **ARRAY** (**ARRAY** 1) is placed in **UNIT** 6, and
**UNIT**\ s 7 and 8 are defined to be placed to the left and right of it
(see :numref:`fig8-1-57`). **UNIT** 7 will complete the two rods at the left
boundary of the **ARRAY** and will contain half of the far left rod in
the completed configuration. In the description of **UNIT** 7, the
**ZHEMICYL+X** is half of the far right rod and is located with its cut
face at the left boundary of a box that is as tall as the entire
**ARRAY** of :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The first **HOLE** 3 in **UNIT** 7 completes
the lower left rod of that **ARRAY**, and the second **HOLE** 3
completes the upper left rod. **UNIT** 8 is constructed in similar
fashion to complete the two rods at the right of the **ARRAY** shown in
Fig. 8.1.53. **UNIT** 8 is the mirror image of **UNIT** 7.
**UNIT**\ s 6, 7, and 8 are stacked in an **ARRAY** (**ARRAY** 2) to
achieve the configuration shown in :numref:`fig8-1-57`. The data to accomplish
this are listed below.

Dodecahedral pitched arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 22.

Dodecahedral pitched **ARRAY**\ s can be described in
KENO-VI by defining the **UNIT**\ s that make up the **ARRAY** as
dodecahedra and in the **ARRAY** data block setting
**TYP**\ =DODECAHEDRAL. Since the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by
stacking dodecahedra, care must be taken to ensure the **ARRAY**
boundary is completely enclosed within the stacked unit. Below is an
example of a dodecahedral **ARRAY** that represents a close packed
**ARRAY** of spheres.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the dodecahedra that make up the
**ARRAY**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel sphere stacked in a dodecahedral
lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to fill in the **ARRAY** so
the **ARRAY** boundary is contained within the stacked **UNIT**\ s.
Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2 contains void.
:numref:`fig8-1-62` shows an isometric, cross section view of **UNIT**\ s 1 and
2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated triangular pitched
assembly of 17 fuel spheres. Dodecahedral **ARRAY**\ s are specified by
using **TYP**\ = followed by keyword dodecahedral in the array data
block. The X and Y coordinates are stacked together as a square pitched
**ARRAY** with the pitch equal to twice the dodecahedron radius. In the
Z dimension, the odd Z planes (Z = 1, 3, 5, etc.) have the X and
Y \ **UNIT**\ s begin at the most negative edge of the **ARRAY**, while
the even Z planes (Z = 2, 4, 6, etc.) have the X and Y \ **UNIT**\ s
begin one dodecahedron inscribed sphere radius in the positive direction
from the most negative edge of the **ARRAY**. Also, the Z distance
between the centers of the **UNIT**\ s in successive Z planes is the
square root of 2.0 times the dodecahedron radius (or the dodecahedron
diameter divided by the square root of 2.0). :numref:`fig8-1-63` and :numref:`fig8-1-64`
show X-Y cross sectional color plots of the assembly at an odd and even

Alternative sample problem mockups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The geometry data for KENO can often be described correctly in several
ways. Some alternative geometry descriptions are given here for sample
problems C.12 and C.13. (See Appendix C of the KENO manual.)

.. _8-1-3-7-1:

Sample Problem C.12, First Alternative
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mockup maintains the same overall unit dimensions that were used in
sample problem C.12. In sample problem C.12, the origin of **UNIT** 1,
the solution cylinder, is at the center of the unit; the origin of
**UNIT**\ s 2, 3, 4, and 5, the metal cylinders, are at the center of
the cylinders. In this mockup, the unit numbers remain the same and the
origin of each unit is at the center of the unit. In each unit the
cylinder is offset by specifying the position of its centerline relative
to the origin of the **UNIT**.

In this mockup, the outer boundaries of the system are made as close
fitting as possible on all six faces. The origin of each **UNIT** is
located at the center of the cylinder. **UNIT**\ s 1, 3, 5, and 7
contain the metal cylinders. **UNIT**\ s 2, 4, 6, and 8 contain the
solution cylinders.

Biasing or weighting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`8-1-3-6-3` discusses the basis of weighting or biasing. The use of
biasing data in reflected problems has been illustrated in Examples 9,
10, and 11 of :ref:`8-1-3-6`. :ref:`8-1-2-7` discusses the input
directions for entering biasing data.

Every **shape** card in KENO V.a, or **MEDIA** card in KENO-VI requires
a bias ID to associate that geometry region with a biasing or weighting
function. A biasing or weighting function is a set of energy-dependent
values of the average weight that are applicable in a given region. The
default function for all bias IDs is constant through all energy groups
and is defined to be the default value of weight average which can be
specified in the parameter data. A bias ID can be associated with a
biasing function (other than default) by specifying it in the biasing
input data. This function can be chosen from the weighting library, or
it can be entered from records. :numref:`tab8-1-20` lists the materials and
energy group structures for biasing functions available from the
weighting library.

In general, the use of biasing should be restricted to external
reflectors unless the user has generated correct biasing functions for
other applications. Improper use of biasing functions can result in
erroneous answers without giving any indication that they are invalid.
Caution should be exercised in the generation and use of biasing
functions.

Biasing functions are most applicable to thick external reflectors.
Their use can significantly reduce the amount of computer time required
to obtain answers in KENO. If the user wishes to use a biasing function
for a concrete reflector, for example, the following steps must be
included in preparing the input data:

1. The geometry region data must define the shape and dimensions of the
reflector using the mixture ID for concrete and a sequence of bias IDs
that associate the geometry region with the appropriate interval of the
concrete weighting function. CAUTION: THE THICKNESS AND SEQUENTIAL
LOCATION OF EACH REGION USING BIASING FUNCTIONS MUST MATCH OR VERY
NEARLY MATCH THE INCREMENT THICKNESS AND ORDER OF THE WEIGHTING DATA. NO
CHECK IS MADE ON THE REQUIREMENT. IT IS THE USER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO
ENSURE CONSISTENCY.

2. Biasing data must be entered. This must include the material ID for
the reflector material (from :numref:`tab8-1-20` or as specified on records)
and a beginning and ending bias ID. The beginning bias ID is used to
select the first set of energy-dependent average weights, and the
subsequent sets of energy-dependent average weights are assigned
consecutive IDs until the ending bias ID is reached.

Small deviations in reflector region thickness are allowed, such as
using three generated regions with a thickness per region of 5.08 cm to
generate a 15.24 cm thick reflector of concrete, or using five generated
regions with a thickness per region of 3.048 cm to generate a 15.24 cm
thick reflector of water. See :numref:`tab8-1-20` for a list of the increment
thicknesses for the materials in the weighting library. It is acceptable
for the thickness of the last reflector region to be significantly
different than the increment thickness. For example, a reflector record
specifying five generated regions with a thickness per region of 3.0 cm
could be followed by a reflector record specifying one region with a
thickness per region of 0.24 cm. Assuming that material 2 is water and a
15.24 cm thick cuboidal reflector of water is desired, the required
reflector description and biasing data could be entered as follows:

Here the weighting functions associated with bias IDs 2, 3, 4, and 5
each have a thickness of 3.0 cm, corresponding exactly to the increment
thickness for water in :numref:`tab8-1-20` Bias ID 6 is used for the last
generated region which is 3.24 cm thick.

The following examples illustrate the use of biasing data. Suppose the
user wishes to use the weighting function for water from Table 8.1.20
for bias IDs 2 through 6. The biasing input data would then be:

::

  READ BIAS  ID=500 2 6 END BIAS

The energy-dependent values of weight average for the first 3 cm
interval of water will be used for weighting the geometry regions that
specify a bias ID of 2. The energy-dependent values of weight average
for the second 3 cm interval of water will be used for geometry regions
that specify a bias ID of 3, etc. Thus, the energy-dependent values of
weight average for the fifth 3 cm interval of water will be used for
geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 6. Geometry regions that use
bias IDs other than 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will use the default value of
weight average that is constant for all energies as a biasing function.

Several sets of biasing data can be entered at once. Assume the user
wishes to use the weighting function for concrete from :numref:`tab8-1-20` for
bias IDs 2 through 4 and the weighting function for water for bias IDs 5
through 7. The appropriate input data block is the following:

::

  READ BIAS  ID=301 2 4 ID=500 5 7 END BIAS

The energy-dependent values of weight average for the first 5 cm
interval of concrete will be used for the geometry regions that specify
a bias ID of 2, the energy-dependent values of weight average for the
second 5 cm interval of concrete will be used for the geometry regions
that specify a bias ID of 3, and the energy-dependent values of weight
average for the third 5 cm interval of concrete will be used for the
geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 4. The energy-dependent
values of weight average for the first 3 cm interval of water will be
used for geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 5, the values for
the second 3 cm interval of water will be used for geometry regions that
specify a bias ID of 6, and the values for the third 3 cm interval of
water will be used for geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 7. The
default value of weight average will be used for all bias IDs outside
the range of 2–7.

If the biasing data block defines the same bias ID more than once, the
value that is entered last supersedes previous entries. Assuming that
the following data block is entered,

::

  READ BIAS  ID=400 2 7 ID=500 5 7 END BIAS

the data for paraffin (ID=400) will be used for bias IDs 2, 3, and 4,
and the data for water (ID=500) will be used for bias IDs 5, 6, and 7.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1. USE OF BIASING DATA

It is assumed that a 5 cm radius sphere of material 2 is reflected by a
20 cm thickness of material 1 (concrete). The concrete reflector is
spherical and close fitting upon the sphere of material 2. The mixing
table must specify material 1 and material 2. Material 1 must be defined
as concrete. The geometry and biasing data should be entered as follows:

The bias ID for the first generated region is 2, the second is 3, the
third is 4, and the fourth is 5. The biasing data block specifies that
the biasing function for material ID 301 (concrete) will be used from
the weighting library. The bias ID to which the energy-dependent
weighting function for the first 5.0 cm interval of concrete is applied
is 2; the energy-dependent weighting function for the fourth 5 cm
interval of concrete is applied to the fourth generated geometry region.
This generated region has a bias ID of 5.

In KENO V.a, Example 1 can also be described without using a reflector
record as shown below. The records that are generated by the reflector
record in the previous set of data are identical to the last four
spheres in this mockup.

Color plots
~~~~~~~~~~~

Plots are generated only if a plot data block has been entered for the
problem and **PLT**\ =NO has not been entered in the parameter data or
the plot data. See :ref:`8-1-2-11` for a description of plot data. When a
plot is to be made, the user MUST correctly specify the upper left-hand
corner of the plot with respect to the origin of the plot. The origin of
a plot is defined as the origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT**.

Plots can represent mixture numbers, unit numbers, or bias ID numbers. A
title can be entered for each plot. If plot titles are omitted, the
title of the KENO case will be printed for each plot title until a plot
title is entered. If a plot title is entered and a subsequent plot title
is omitted, the last plot title prior to the omitted one will be used
for the omitted one.

The upper left and lower right coordinates define the area (i.e., the
slice and its location) for which the plot is to be made. The direction
cosines across the plot and the direction cosines down the plot define
the direction of the vector across the plot and the vector down the plot
with respect to the geometry coordinate system. One of the simplest ways
of generating a plot is to specify the desired coordinates of the upper
left and lower right corners of the plot. Then one must determine which
plot axis is to be across the plot and which is to be down. The sign of
the direction cosine should be consistent with the direction of that
component when moving from the upper left to lower right corner. For
example, to draw a plot of an X‑Z slice at Y = 5.0 with X across the
plot and Z down the plot for a system whose X coordinates ranges from
0.0 to 10.0 and whose Z coordinates range from 0.0 to 20.0, the upper
left coordinate could be **XUL**\ =0.0 **YUL**\ =5.0 **ZUL**\ =20.0 and
the lower right coordinates could be **XLR**\ =10.0 **YLR**\ =5.0
**ZLR**\ =0.0. Since X is to be plotted across the plot with X = 0.0 at
the left and X = 10.0 at the right, only the X component of the
direction cosines across the plot need be entered. It should be positive
because going from 0.0 to 10.0 is moving in the positive direction.
Thus, **UAX**\ =1.0 would be entered for the direction cosines across
the plot. **VAX** and **WAX** could be omitted. Z is to be plotted down
the plot with Z = 20.0 at the top and Z = 0.0 at the bottom. Therefore,
only the Z component of the direction cosines down the plot needs to be
defined. It should be negative because moving from 20.0 to 0.0 is moving
in the negative direction. Thus, **WDN** = −1.0 would be entered for the
direction cosines down the plot. **UDN** and **VDN** could be omitted.
The sign of the direction cosines should be consistent with the
coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners in order to get a
plot.

It is not necessary that the plot be made for a slice orthogonal to one
of the axes. Plots can be made of slices cut at any desired angle, but
the user should exercise caution and be well aware of the distortion of
shapes that can be introduced. (Nonorthogonal slices through cylinders
plot as ellipses.)

The user can specify the horizontal and vertical spacing between points
on the plot. It is usually advisable to enter one or the other. Entering
both can cause distortion of the plot. **DLX**\ = is used to specify the
horizontal spacing between points and **DLD**\ = is used to specify the
vertical spacing between points. When only one of them is specified, the
code calculates the correct value of the other so the plot will not be
distorted. **DLX** or **DLD** can be specified by the user to be small
enough to show the desirable detail in the plot. The plot is generated
by starting at the upper left corner of the plot and generating a point
every **DLX** across the plot; then moving down **DLD** and repeating
the generation of the points across the plot.

**NAX** specifies the number of intervals (pixels) that will be printed
across the plot. **NDN** specifies the number of intervals (pixels) that
will be printed down the plot. If both **NAX** and **NDN** are entered,
the plot may be distorted. If one of them is entered, the value of the
other will be calculated so the plot will not be distorted.

When a plot is being made, the first pixel represents the coordinates of
the upper left corner. The value of **DELV** is added to the coordinate
that is to be printed across the plot, and the next pixel is printed.
**DELV** is added to that value to determine the location of the next
pixel, that is, a point is determined every **DELV** across the plot and
a pixel is printed for each point. When a line has been completed, a new
line is begun **DELU** from the first line. This procedure is repeated
until the plot is complete.

The plot data blocks included above are set up to draw a mixture map of
an X-Y slice taken at the half height (Z=0.0) and a unit map for the
same slice. In the above examples, the geometry dimensions extend from X
= −4.3 to X = 4.3, from Y = −4.3, to Y = 4.3, and from Z = −16.0 to Z =
16.0. An X-Y slice is be printed at the half height (Z = 0.0). The
desired plot data sets the upper left-hand corner of the plot to be
X = −4.6 and Y = 4.6. The lower right-hand corner of the plot is
specified as X = 4.6 and Y = −4.6. These data are entered by specifying
the upper left-hand corner as **XUL**\ = −4.6 **YUL**\ =4.6
**ZUL**\ =0.0 and the lower right-hand corner as **XLR**\ =4.6
**YLR**\ = −4.6 **ZLR**\ =0.0. It is desired to print X across the plot
and Y down the plot. Therefore, the X direction cosine is specified
across the plot, in the direction from X = −4.6 to X = 4.6 as
**UAX**\ =1.0. The Y direction cosine is specified down the plot, from
Y = 4.6 to Y = −4.6 as **VDN**\ = −1.0.

A black border will be printed for points outside the range of the
problem geometry description. By setting the plot dimension slightly
larger than the geometry dimension, a black border will be printed
around the specified plot. This verifies that the outer boundaries of
the geometry are contained within the plot dimensions. NAX is the number
of pixels across for a color plot. An initial recommended range for NAX
is between 600 and 800 pixels. The resulting plots are shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-65` and :numref:`fig8-1-66`. The associated data for both plots are
shown in :numref:`list8-1-1` and :numref:`list8-1-2`.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 2. SINGLE UNIT WITH OFFSET ORIGIN.

The physical problem is the same as that described in Example 1: two
concentric cylinders in a cuboid. The dimensions are exactly the same,
and the difference is in the choice of the origin. In this geometry
description, the origin was specified as the most negative point of the
unit. Thus, the cylinders must have an origin specified to center them
in the cuboid, and the cuboid extends from 0.0 to 8.6 in X and Y and
from 0.0 to 32 in Z as shown in the problem description below.

The plot data included above will draw a mixture map of an X-Y slice
taken at the half height (Z = 16.0). It will also draw a unit map of the
same slice. The plot dimensions extend 0.3 cm beyond the problem
dimensions to provide a black border around the plot. The associated
plot data specification for the mixture map is shown in :numref:`list8-1-3`, the
mixture map is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-70`, and the associated plot data for
the unit map is shown in :numref:`list8-1-4`. The unit map is identical to
:numref:`fig8-1-66` and is not included.

As stated at the beginning of :ref:`8-1-3-9`, the origin of a plot is
defined as the origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT**. Each individual unit in
the array is 8.6 cm wide in X and Y and 32 cm high in Z. Since the array
has two units stacked in each direction, the array is 17.2 cm wide in X
and Y and is 64 cm high. Therefore, the array exists from X = 0.0 to X =
17.2, from Y = 0.0 to Y = 17.2 and from Z = 0.0 to Z = 64.0.

The first color plot is to generate an X-Y slice through the array at
the half height (Z = 16.0 cm) of the first layer as shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-72`. It is desirable to create an image with a larger extent
than the global unit to ensure that the boundaries are as expected. This
is achieved by setting the boundaries of the plot larger than the array.
In this case, the boundaries were arbitrarily set 0.3 cm larger than the
array, resulting in a black border around the array. If the plot were to
exclude everything external to the array, the following coordinates
could have been entered: **XUL**\ =0.0 **YUL**\ =17.2 **ZUL**\ =16.0
**XLR**\ =17.2 **YLR**\ =0.0 **ZLR**\ =16.0. This would have eliminated
the black border. The existing plot was made using **XUL**\ = −0.3
**YUL**\ =17.5 **ZUL**\ =16.0 **XLR**\ =17.5 **YLR**\ = −0.3
**ZLR**\ =16.0.

  X-Y plot of 2 × 2 × 2 bare array.

The second color plot is to generate an X-Z slice through the center of
the front row of the array. In order to obtain a black border, the
coordinates of X and Z were arbitrarily set 1.0 cm larger than the
boundaries of the array. The center of the front row occurs at Y = 12.9.
The coordinates of the plot were: **XUL**\ = −1.0 **ZUL**\ =65.0
**YUL**\ =12.9 **XLR**\ =18.2 **ZLR**\ = −1.0 **YLR**\ =12.9. The
resulting mixture map is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-73`.

The **ARRAY** record specifies the array number and the coordinates of
the most negative point of the array to be (0.0,0.0,0.0) and the
coordinates of the most positive point to be (17.2,17.2,64.0). Thus the
reflected array extends from -15.24 cm to +32.44 cm in X and Y and from
-15.24 to +79.24 in Z.

The first color plot for this example is to show an X-Y slice through
the array and reflector at the half height of the bottom layer. A black
border is used to verify that the entire reflector has been shown. This
is accomplished by arbitrarily setting the plot boundaries 1 cm beyond
the reflector boundaries. The coordinates used for this plot are **XUL**
= −16.24 **YUL** = 33.44 **ZUL** = 16.0 **XLR** = 33.44 **YLR** = 16.24
**ZLR** = 16.0. The plot data description is shown in :numref:`list8-1-5`, and
the plot is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-75`.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 5. A 2 × 2 × 2 REFLECTED ARRAY WITH THE ORIGIN CENTERED IN THE
  ARRAY

This example is physically identical to Example 4. The difference is in
the specification of the origin. The bare array is 17.2 cm wide in X and
Y and 64 cm high. The origin (0,0,0) can be placed at the exact center
of the array by specifying the most negative point of the array as X =
−8.6, Y = −8.6 and Z = −32.0. This is done using the **ARRAY**
description in the geometry block. Because the origin is located at a
different position, the coordinates of the plots will also be different.
The input data description for this example is given below.

.he plot data description for the **UNIT** plot of nested holes is shown
in :numref:`list8-1-13`. The **UNIT** plot is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-92`. The user can
reference this map to verify the correct placement of the **UNIT**\ s.
Note that the **UNIT** map plots the **UNIT**\ s present at the deepest
nesting level for the 2-D slice. It does not show any detail within a
**UNIT**. The apparent detail within **UNIT** 7 includes
**UNIT**\ s 1–6, which were placed there via the hole option. In the
legend of the plot, the material number actually refers to the **UNIT**
number.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 7. LARGE STORAGE ARRAY.

The storage array described Example 18 in :ref:`8-1-3-6-3` and
:numref:`fig8-1-27` is such a sparse array that the mixture map had to be very
large in order to show the detail of the shelves and uranium buttons.
The mixture maps for this configuration were not presented in
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3`, but the data description was listed so the user can
generate them. It may be useful to generate a **UNIT** map for this kind
of problem. The input data for generating unit maps for this storage
array is given below.

KENO Multiple Mesh and Mesh-based Quantity Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KENO creates a grid and stores several mesh definitions in this object.
The following mesh definitions are supported by KENO:

i. Default mesh (grid **ID** =10001):

KENO generates a 5 × 5 × 5 Cartesian mesh which overlays the entire
geometry. This mesh is always used for fission source convergence
diagnostics if the user does not specify any mesh for this quantity.
Currently users cannot enter grid **ID**\ s greater than 9999.

ii. Simple mesh (grid **ID** = 20001):

KENO generates a uniform simple mesh with the mesh size specified by the
user with the MSH parameter, which is introduced in Table 9.1.1. This
mesh definition is only used for mesh flux calculations.

iii. Mesh with **READ GRID** block (grid **ID** = NUMBER):

The user can specify either a mesh with a single **READ GRID** block or
multiple meshes by repeating the **READ GRID** block with different mesh
definitions. Note that the entire block, including **READ GRID** and
**END GRID**, must be repeated each time; this behavior is different
from all other blocks of KENO input.

After setting up all mesh, KENO tries to match the IDs specified in the
parameter block with the keywords **SCD**, **MFX**, **CDS**, **CGD**,
and **GFX** (See :ref:`8-1-2-3`) to the grid **ID** in each grid
definition. Each mesh-based quantity requested by the user is associated
with a grid if the requested grid **ID** exists.

The following examples demonstrate the mesh features in KENO:

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1: SOURCE CONVERGENCE DIAGNOSTICS WITH DEFAULT MESH


KENO always generates a default mesh for source convergence diagnostics
if the user does not specify any mesh for this quantity. The following
example (only KENO-VI version is shown) will be used in all examples in
this section to summarize several mesh definition scenarios with several
mesh-based quantity requests. In this sample problem, a bounding box is
defined to enclose the entire geometry with xmin=‑13.01, xmax=13.01,
ymin=-13.74, ymax=13.74, zmin=-13.74, and zmax=13.74. KENO uses this
bounding box and creates a 5 × 5 × 5 grid for source convergence
diagnostics.

The user can request the accumulation of the fission source on a
different grid rather than the default grid for source convergence
diagnostics. In this example, the sample problem specified in EXAMPLE 1
is modified for this purpose. A new 6x6x6 grid is defined over the
entire geometry in a **READ GRID** block with a grid **ID** 12, and
source convergence diagnostics are requested by setting **SCD**
parameter to 12 in the parameter block that matches the NUMBER

This example demonstrates the multiple mesh definition for multiple
mesh-based quantities. Our sample problem is modified so that (1) two
grids have been defined with the **READ GRID** data block, and (2) both
the source convergence diagnostics and mesh flux tally are requested. In
this sample, the grid with grid ID = 12 is assigned to the source
convergence diagnostics, and the grid with grid ID = 1 is assigned to
the mesh flux tally.

Random sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random-number package used by KENO always starts with the same seed
and thus always reproduces the same sequence of random numbers. Any
random number except the one printed as the starting random number in
the parameter table can be used to activate a different random sequence.
The user can rerun a problem with a different random sequence by simply
entering a hexadecimal random number other than the starting random
number in the parameter data. For example, by entering RND=A10C1893E6D5
in the parameter data, the problem will be run with a different random
sequence.

.. _8-1-3-12:

Matrix k-effective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix k-effective calculations provide an alternative method of
calculating the k-effective of the system. Cofactor k-effectives and
source vectors are additional information that can be provided when the
matrix k-effective is calculated. The necessary source and fission
weight data are collected during the neutron tracking procedure. This
information is converted to a FISSION PRODUCTION MATRIX, which is the
number of next generation neutrons produced at J by a neutron born at I.
The principal eigenvalue of the fission probability matrix is the matrix
k-effective. KENO offers four alternatives when calculating matrix
k-effective as discussed below:

(1) If **MKP**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by array position or position index in
the GLOBAL ARRAY. The position index is used to reference a given
location in a 3-D lattice. For a 2 × 2 × 2 array, there are nine unique
position indices as shown below. Position zero contains everything
outside the GLOBAL ARRAY.

  | 8 | 2        | 2 | 2 |
  +---+----------+---+---+

The fission production matrix is the number of next generation neutrons
produced at index J by a neutron born at index I. This matrix is used to
calculate the matrix k-effective, cofactor k‑effectives and the source
vector by position index. Because the size of the fission probability
matrix is the square of the array size (for a 4 × 4 × 4 array there are
4,096 entries), it can use vast amounts of computer memory.

(2) If **MKU**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by **UNIT**. It is the number of next
generation neutrons produced in **UNIT** J by a neutron born in
**UNIT** I. This matrix is used to calculate the matrix k-effective,
cofactor k-effectives and source vector by **UNIT**.

(3) If **MKH**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by the **HOLE** number. Matrix
information can be collected at either the highest **HOLE** nesting
level (first level of nesting) or the deepest **HOLE** nesting level.
**HHL**\ =YES specifies that the matrix information will be collected at
the first nesting level. By default, the matrix information is collected
at the deepest nesting level. The fission production matrix is the
number of next generation neutrons produced in **HOLE** J by a neutron
born in **HOLE** I. This matrix is used to calculate the matrix
k-effective, cofactor k-effectives and the source vector by **HOLE**.

(4) If **MKA**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by **ARRAY** number. It can be collected
at the highest **ARRAY** level (first level of nesting) or at the
deepest **ARRAY** level. **HAL**\ =YES specifies that the matrix
information will be collected at the first nesting level. By default,
the matrix information is collected at the deepest nesting level. The
fission production matrix is the number of next generation neutrons
produced in **ARRAY** J by a neutron born in **ARRAY** I. This matrix is
used to calculate the matrix k-effective, cofactor k-effectives and the
source vector by **ARRAY**.

The user can simultaneously implement all methods of calculating the
matrix k-effective. The results are labeled in the printout. Matrix
k-effectives cannot be calculated for a single unit problem. If the user
wishes to do so, the geometry description must have a cube or cuboid as
its outer region, and the problem description should include **READ
ARRAY END ARRAY**. These two actions convert the single unit problem
into a 1 × 1 × 1 array.

A cofactor k-effective is the eigenvalue of the fission production
matrix reduced by the row and column that references the specified
**UNIT** or position index. The difference between the k-effective for
the system and the cofactor k-effective for a **UNIT** or position index
is an indication of the *in situ* k-effective of that **UNIT** or the
contribution that **UNIT** makes to the k-effective of the system. The
cofactor k‑effective of a **UNIT** devoid of fissile material should
approximate the k-effective of the system.

Deviations
~~~~~~~~~~


When a deviation is calculated by KENO, it is the standard deviation of
the mean. This assumes a large sample having a normal distribution.
KENO calculates the real variance using an iterative approach and lag
covariance data between generations as follows :cite:`demaret_accurate_1999,becker_proof_2009`

1. The sample variance and covariance estimates are calculated.

2. The apparent variance is set equal to the sample variance and the
   apparent covariance is set equal to the sample covariance.

3. The real covariance is set equal to the apparent covariance and the
   real variance is calculated.

4. Using the real variance and apparent covariance calculate the real
   covariance.

5. The real variance is recalculated.

6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the real variance converges within a
   preset tolerance.

The covariance estimates are only calculated for the previous
20 generations. A maximum of 50 iterations are allowed for the real
variance to converge.

.. _8-1-3-14:

Generation time and lifetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generation time and lifetime calculations use the average velocity.
The validity of these calculations is determined by how accurately the
average velocity represents the spectrum over the range of the energy
group. The lifetime and generation time calculated by KENO are not
kinetics parameters. The lifetime is the average life span of a neutron
(in seconds) from the time it is born until it is absorbed or leaks from
the system. The generation time is the average time (in seconds) between
successive neutron generations.

.. _8-1-3-15:

Energy of the Average Lethargy of Fission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The energy of the average lethargy of neutrons causing fission (*EALF*)
is a parameter calculated in KENO to characterize the neutron energy
spectrum or fastness of a system. The *EALF* is given in units of eV in
the KENO output. An *EALF* value that is high (> 100 keV) indicates that
most fissions in the system are being caused by fast neutrons, and an
*EALF* value that is low (< 1 eV) indicates that most fissions are
induced by thermal neutrons.

The *EALF* is calculated by determining the lethargy, :math:`u`, a
measure of how much neutron energy changes from its initial or birth
energy:


.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-1

  u = ln\left( \frac{E_{0}}{E} \right),


where :math:`E` is the energy of the neutron colliding with a nucleus
and :math:`E_{0}` is the maximum possible energy of fission neutrons
(assumed in KENO to be 10 MeV). The average lethargy of all fission
events is calculated by weighting the lethargy for each collision by the
probability that the collision will create a fission event, and
averaging this quantity. Using a log-scale parameter like lethargy to
represent the fastness of systems is more convenient than directly
averaging the energy of neutrons causing fission both because of the
wide range of neutrons in a problem (potentially more than seven orders
of magnitude), and because fast neutrons that are slowing down lose
about the same fraction of their energy during each collision.

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-2

  EALF = E_{o}e^{- u_{\text{avg}}}


Equation :eq:`eq8-1-2` is then applied again to transform the average lethargy of
neutrons causing fission into a neutron energy that corresponds to the
average lethargy of neutrons causing fission (this is the *EALF*); this
transformation back to units of energy is done because energy has a much
more intuitive meaning than units of lethargy.

Description of Output
---------------------

This section contains a brief description and explanation of the KENO
output. Portions of the printout will not be printed for every problem.
Some printout is optional, as noted in this section. This section
provides representative samples of the output format. The actual data
contained in this section are not necessarily consistent with results
computed by the current version of KENO.

KENO offers an HTML output format including a series of files that can
be viewed in a standard web browser. The HTML formatted output offers
interactive output that is easy to read and navigate. Many of the tables
of data can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on
the heading of the column for which sorting is desired. Interactive
plotting of fluxes, fission production, absorption, and k-effective
values are also available within the HTML output through an applet
version of the Javapeño plotting package. In this section, the standard
text output description is followed by a description of the optional
HTML formatted output. The HTML formatted output can be deactivated by
entering HTM=NO in the parameter data section.

Program verification information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program verification information :numref:`list8-1-16` is printed after the
header page. It lists the name of the program, the date the load module
was created, the library that contains the load module, the computer
code name from the configuration control table, and the revision number.
The job name, date, and time of execution are also printed. This
information may be used for quality assurance purposes.

For the logical parameter data table, messages concerning the parameter
data may be printed at the bottom of the table. If the problem is being
restarted, the title of the parent case is printed at the bottom of the
table. If the restart title or messages are not printed, the bottom
section of the table is omitted.

.. _8-1-4-3:

Unprocessed geometry input data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This printout is optional and is usually used to locate code
difficulties, to show all the geometry input data when only part of it
is used in the problem, or to show the order in which units were
entered. It is considered debug information and is printed only if
**PGM**\ =YES is specified in the parameter input data. Standard KENO
use does not require printing these data because the processed geometry
that is used in the problem is always printed. See :ref:`8-1-4-52-9` and
:ref:`8-1-4-13`. for examples of the standard printed KENO geometry data.

When the unprocessed geometry input is printed, the problem title is
located at the top of the page, followed by the heading “GEOMETRY
DESCRIPTION INPUT.” The region-dependent geometry information is then
printed. If the problem contains a unit orientation array, the problem
title is printed again, followed by the unit orientation. This is
followed by a statement affirming the completion of the data input.

.. _8-1-4-4:

Table of data sets used in the problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table is the third table of data printed by KENO. It should be
carefully scrutinized to verify the desired data set name is associated
with the proper unit number and volume. An example of this table is
shown in :numref:`list8-1-19`.

This table lists unit numbers specified in the parameter data or that
are defaulted in the code, along with the information pertinent to them.
This information is given in the following order, left to right: (1) the
keyword used in the parameter data to define the unit number, (2) the
unit number, (3) the data set name, (4) the name of the volume on which
the data set resides, and (5) the type of data contained on the data
set. This table can be useful for quality assurance purposes.
Information for units for which default values have not been overridden
is printed even though they may not be used in the problem. Information
for every unit specified in the parameter data is also printed. Units 8
and 10 are the direct-access devices, and their unit numbers are fixed
within the code. When this table is printed, Unit 10 has not yet been
defined. This causes its data set names to be listed as FT10F001 or as
“UNKNOWN” on some systems. If KENO is run as part of a CSAS sequence,
this table will include two entries for Unit 95: one for binary input
data, and one for read restart data.

Table of additional information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fourth table of data printed by KENO contains additional information
determined from the input data. An example of this table is shown in
:numref:`list8-1-20`.

This table should be used to verify the problem input. The NUMBER OF
ENERGY GROUPS for a multigroup problem is read either from the
Monte Carlo formatted library, identified by the keyword **XSC** and the
unit function name MIXED CROSS SECTIONS from the Table of Data Sets in
:ref:`8-1-4-4`, or from the restart unit, identified by the keyword
**RST** and the unit function name, READ RESTART DATA. The NO. OF
FISSION SPECTRUM SOURCE GROUP is the number of different energy groups
for which a fission spectrum is defined. In the present version, this
number should always be 1. The NO. OF SCATTERING ANGLES IN XSECS is the
number of scattering angles to be used in processing the cross sections.
The default value is one, and it may be overridden by specifying the
parameter **SCT**\ = in the mixing table input. One scattering angle
yields P\ :sub:`1` cross sections, two scattering angles yield
P\ :sub:`3` cross sections, three scattering angles yield P\ :sub:`5`
cross sections, etc. ENTRIES/NEUTRON IN THE NEUTRON BANK specifies the
number of pieces of data that are banked for each history during
tracking. ENTRIES/NEUTRON IN THE FISSION BANK is the amount of data
stored for each source neutron for each generation.

The NUMBER OF MIXTURES USED is the number of different mixtures (media)
used in the geometry data used by the problem. This may be less than the
total number of different mixtures specified in the geometry data if
portions of the geometry data are not used in the problem.

The NUMBER OF BIAS IDS USED is the number of different biasing regions
used in the problem. This will always be one unless a biasing data block
is entered.

The NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL ALBEDOS USED is the number of different
differential albedo reflectors used in the problem. This will always be
zero unless the boundary condition data specify the use of differential
albedo reflection on one or more faces of the system as described in
:ref:`8-1-4-7`. The BOUNDARY CONDITION data printed in this table should
also be checked. The number of different differential albedos specified
on the faces should be consistent with the NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL
ALBEDOS USED. Specular, mirror, vacuum, and periodic are not
differential albedos. Several different keywords may be used to specify
the same differential albedo.

The TOTAL INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS is the number of geometry regions
specified in the problem input. This excludes UNIT label and comments
provided using COM=, but it includes the array boundary description.
It excludes the automatic reflector description, but it includes the
geometry regions generated by it. The NUMBER OF GEOMETRY REGIONS USED is
the number of geometry regions used in the problem. It may be less than
or equal to the TOTAL INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS. The LARGEST GEOMETRY UNIT
NUMBER is the largest unit number defined in the geometry data,
including unused units and implicitly defined units. Implicitly defined
unit numbers are created when a core boundary specification is not
immediately preceded by a specification. The unit number is assigned by
the code by adding one to the largest unit number encountered in the
geometry region data. For example, if two such core boundary
specifications are contained in a problem whose largest explicitly
defined unit number is 7, then a unit number of 8 is assigned to the
first one, and a unit number of 9 is assigned to the second one. A value
of 9 would be printed for the LARGEST GEOMETRY UNIT NUMBER. The LARGEST
ARRAY NUMBER is the largest array number specified in the array data.

USE LATTICE GEOMETRY is determined by the logical flag that indicates
whether or not the problem is a single unit problem. This should be YES
for any problem that is not a single unit problem and NO for a single
unit problem. By definition, a single unit problem does not use array
data in any form. :ref:`8-1-4-12` describes array data. The GLOBAL
ARRAY NUMBER is the number of the array designated as the global,
overall, or universal array. The global array can be thought of as the
array that defines the overall system.

The NUMBER OF UNITS IN THE GLOBAL X/Y/Z DIR. defines the size of the
global array in terms of the number of units that are located along the
edge of the array boundaries in the X/Y/Z directions. For a single unit,
all three of these should be zero. For a simple 1 × 1 × 1 array
consisting of one unit type, all three of these numbers should be 1.

USE GLOBAL REFLECTOR indicates if the global array is reflected.

USE NESTED HOLES is set YES if holes are nested deeper than one level.

NUMBER OF HOLES is the number of HOLES that are entered in the geometry
region data.

The MAXIMUM HOLE NESTING LEVEL is the deepest level of hole nesting.

USE NESTED ARRAYS is set YES if arrays are nested deeper than one level.

The NUMBER OF ARRAYS USED is the number of array descriptions actually
used in the problem description.

MAXIMUM ARRAY NESTING LEVEL is the deepest level of array nesting.

Six BOUNDARY CONDITIONs are printed near the bottom of the table. They
show the type of boundary condition that is applied to each face of the
system. These should all be VACUUM unless albedo boundary conditions are
applied to one or more faces of the system. One should refer to the
NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL ALBEDOS USED, as discussed previously in the
description of this table of information.

Mixing table data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If **LIB=** is entered in the KENO parameter data and a mixing table
data block is provided to KENO, mixing table data will be printed. This
output edit is not considered optional because it cannot be suppressed
if the necessary data are present. Sample mixing table data are shown in
:numref:`list8-1-21` In the HTML output, the mixing table data can be accessed
with the *Mixing Table* link in the *Input Data* section.

The data printed in this table include the problem title, the number of
scattering angles, and the cross section message threshold. Data are
then printed for each mixture. First the mixture number, density, and
temperature are printed, followed by a table of the nuclides which make
up the mixture. This table contains the following data: nuclide
ID number, nuclide mixture ID number, atom density, weight fraction of
nuclide in mixture, ZA number, atomic weight, temperature, and nuclide
title. Mixture temperature is the same as the nuclides’ temperatures for
the multigroup calculations, but it may be different for the continuous
energy calculations if Doppler broadening is not enabled since the
nuclides are loaded from libraries with the closest temperature. After
all mixture data have been printed, a table of nuclides and descriptive
titles is printed for all nuclides included in the mixtures. If extra
1-D cross sections were specified in the problem (see **X1D**\ =,
:ref:`8-1-2-3`), the extra 1-D cross section IDs will be printed under
the heading “1-D CROSS SECTION ARRAY ID NUMBERS.” If is to be calculated
(parameter **NUB**\ =YES), six MT numbers will be printed. The MT number
for the total cross section (Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 1; the MT number for the sum
of the transfer array normalized byΣ\ :sub:`T` is 2002; the MT number
for the normalized fission-product cross section (νΣ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`t`)
is 1452; the MT number for the normalized absorption cross section
(Σ\ :sub:`abs`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 27; the MT number for the normalized fission
cross section (Σ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 18; and the MT number for the
fission spectrum (χ) is 1018. χ is summed and normalized to 1.0. Other
MT numbers in this list have been specified by the user. If the number
of blocks on the direct access data set are insufficient to hold the
cross section data, a message is printed stating THE NUMBER OF DIRECT
ACCESS BLOCKS ON UNIT____\_ HAS BEEN INCREASED TO \____. If the problem
is to write a restart data set (parameter **RES**\ =), a message is
printed stating that restart information was written, and the restart
I/O unit number is specified. This is followed by a statement of the
number of I/Os used in preparing the cross sections. The user should
examine the mixing table carefully to verify that the proper nuclides
are specified for the proper mixtures and that all the data are correct.
The mixing table is printed in subroutine PRTMIX.

Albedo cross section correspondence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the albedo cross section correspondence tables is optional. The
headings for the tables are printed in subroutine CORRE, and then
subroutine RATIO prints the data. These tables are printed only if
**PAX**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data as described in
:ref:`8-1-2-3`. Examples of these tables are shown in :numref:`list8-1-22` and
:numref:`list8-1-23`.

The table shown in :numref:`list8-1-22` contains, left to right, the cross
section energy group, the lower and upper lethargy bounds, the
corresponding albedo energy groups, and the cumulative probability
associated with each albedo energy group for choosing the albedo energy
group corresponding to the cross section energy group. The table shown
in :numref:`list8-1-23` is the inverse of the table shown in :numref:`list8-1-22`. It
provides the cumulative probabilities for choosing the cross section
energy group corresponding to the albedo energy group. The information
in these tables is automatically generated by KENO.

1-D macroscopic cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decision to print the 1-D mixture cross sections is optional. They
are printed only if **XS1**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data.
When the 1-D cross sections are to be printed, they are printed a group
at a time for each mixture. The 1-D mixture cross sections for a mixture
are shown in :numref:`list8-1-24`.

When the 1-D mixture cross sections are printed, the problem title is
printed at the top of the page. The mixture ID, mixture index, and
mixture number are then printed. ID is the mixture number from the
mixing table, and mixture index is the index used to reference it and
mixture number is its identifier. This step is followed by a heading to
identify the different 1-D cross sections. *GROUP* is the energy group,
*sigt* is the total cross section for the mixture, *sigs* is the
nonabsorption probability, *siga* is the absorption probability, *signu*
is the production probability, *chi* is the fission spectrum, *mwa1* is
the pointer for the first position of the cross sections for the energy
group, *mwa2* is the pointer for the last position of the cross sections
for the energy group, and *mwa3* contains the group for the transfer
corresponding to the first position. *SUM* is the sum of the absorption
probability and the nonabsorption probability. The absorption
probability is defined as the absorption cross section divided by the
total cross section. The nonabsorption probability is the sum of the
group-to-group transfers for this group, divided by the total
cross section. The production probability is defined as the fission
production cross section divided by the total cross section
(νΣ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`). The nonabsorption probability and the production
probability are not true probabilities in that they may be greater than
1. This is because the nonabsorption probability has the (n,2n) transfer
array summed into the total transfer array twice, and the (n,3n) is
summed three times, etc.

Extra 1-d cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the extra 1-D cross sections is optional. They are printed if
**P1D**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data. Extra 1-D
cross sections are not used in KENO unless **NUB**\ =YES is specified in
the parameter data or the user has altered the code to access and
utilize other 1-D cross sections. If \ **NUB**\ =YES is specified, the
extra 1-D cross section is the fission cross section, which is used to
calculate the average number of neutrons per fission. This is printed
only for fissile mixtures as shown in :numref:`list8-1-24`. The fission cross
section heading follows the table of 1‑D cross sections. The fission
cross section heading is XSEC ID 18, and it follows the table of 1-D
cross sections.

2-D macroscopic cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decision to print the 2-D mixture cross sections is optional. They
are printed only if **XS2**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data.
They are printed after the 1-D cross sections for the mixture. A
heading is printed, followed by the transfer data. An example of the
2-D mixture cross sections is given in :numref:`list8-1-25`.

Probabilities and angles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the probabilities and angles is optional. They are printed if
the number of scattering angles is greater than zero and **XAP**\ =YES
is specified in the parameter data. Examples of the probabilities are
shown in :numref:`list8-1-26`. Examples of the angles are shown in :numref:`list8-1-27`. If the group-to-group
transfer for a mixture is isotropic, the first angle for that transfer
will be set to −2.0 as a flag to the code.

The ARRAY NUMBER is the number by which the array is designated in the
input data. The number of units in the X, Y, and Z directions is listed
for each array. The NESTING LEVEL indicates the level of nesting for
each array. The global, overall, or universe array is flagged by the
word GLOBAL. The global array should always appear at the first nesting
level. Arrays that have been placed in the global reflector by using
holes should also appear at the first nesting level. A nesting level of
one is the highest or first nesting levels. The larger the number in the
nesting level column, the deeper the nesting level will be.

Geometry data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The geometry region data used by the problem are always printed and
cannot be suppressed. They should be carefully examined by the user to
verify the mixture number, bias ID, and geometry specifications used in
the problem. If geometry region data are entered but are not referenced
in the unit orientation array data, they will not be printed here. An
example would be to enter geometry region data describing Units 1, 2, 3,
and 4 and to use only Units 1, 3, and 4 in the unit orientation array.
Then the geometry region data for Unit 2 will not be printed. An example
of the KENO V.a geometry region printout for a problem is given in
:numref:`list8-1-29`.

The problem title and a heading are printed at the top of each page.
REGION is the region number within a unit. Each unit has its regions
numbered sequentially, beginning with one. MEDIA NUM is the mixture
number or mixture ID that occupies the volume defined by the region.
BIAS ID is the bias ID that corresponds to the desired set of weight
average for biasing the region. The unit number is printed at the top of
each unit’s geometry region description near the center of the page. The
data printed for each geometry region include (1) the region number
relative to the unit (numbered sequentially within the unit), (2) the
shape of the geometry region, (3) the mixture ID of the material within
the volume defined by the region, (4) the bias ID to define the average
weight of a neutron in the region, and (5) the dimensions defining the
outer boundaries of the geometry region. If additional geometry
surrounds an array, a heading is printed stating: UNIT \___\_ EXTERNAL
TO LATTICE \____. The lattice number is the number of the array that is
surrounded by the specified geometry. The unit number is the unit that
contains the specified geometry. In the case of an external reflector
for the global array, the unit number is assigned by the code.

Unit orientation description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each unit orientation description defines the location of units in the
3-D lattice that represent the specified array. The array described is
identified in the heading UNIT ORIENTATION DESCRIPTION FOR ARRAY \____.
The arrays used in the problem are stacked together to represent the
physical problem being analyzed. The unit orientation description is not
printed if only Unit 1 is described in the problem. The user should
carefully examine the unit orientation descriptions to ensure proper
placement of the units in each lattice. A sample unit orientation
description is shown in :numref:`list8-1-30` .

If a very large array is used by the problem, its unit orientation
description may be spread over several pages. When checking the
printout, the user should pay careful attention to the headings that
indicate the portion of each lattice being printed. The detailed
printout of an array may be suppressed using the ARRAY parameter PRT=no.

Volume information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The volume information printout differs between KENO V.a and KENO-VI.
Because it does not allow intersections of bodies, KENO V.a is always
able to calculate analytically the volume of any region in the geometry.
KENO-VI, on the other hand, never calculates volumes analytically. In
fact, KENO-VI never calculates volumes unless it is directed to do so,
but it can read volumes off the **MEDIA** cards or off a **VOLUME** file
(:ref:`8-1-2-13`).

.. _8-1-4-15-1:

KENO V.a
^^^^^^^^

Three tables of volumes are always printed and cannot be suppressed. The
problem title is printed at the top of the page, followed by the heading
“VOLUMES FOR THOSE UNITS UTILIZED IN THIS PROBLEM.” An example of the
volume printout is given in .

The first table is arranged by ascending unit number. It includes
(1) the unit number, (2) the region number within the unit, (3) the
overall geometry region number, (4) the net volume of each individual
region, and (5) the cumulative volume through each region in the unit.
The cumulative volume of the last region in a unit is the total volume
of the unit. The unit number is printed under the heading UNIT. Data
listed under the heading REGION refer to the number of the geometry
region within the unit. The geometry regions within a unit are numbered
sequentially starting with 1. Data entered under the heading GEOMETRY
REGION refer to the entry number of the individual geometry region.
These are numbered sequentially, starting with 1, through the TOTAL
INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS defined in :numref:`list8-1-31`. The net volume of each individual
region is calculated by subtracting the volume of the interior region
from the volume of the region and is listed under the heading VOLUME.
The data listed under the heading CUMULATIVE VOLUME are calculated from
the dimensions of the region. A simple example demonstrating how volumes
are calculated can be given by assuming a unit that is composed of three
concentric cubes. Region 1 is a cube 3 cm on a side, region 2 is a cube
4 cm on a side, and region 3 is a cube 5 cm on a side. The cumulative
volume of region 1 is 27 cm\ :sup:`3` (3:sup:`3`); the cumulative volume
of region 2 is 64 cm\ :sup:`3` (4:sup:`3`); the cumulative volume of
region 3 is 125 cm\ :sup:`3` (5:sup:`3`). The volume of region 1 is
27 cm\ :sup:`3` (3:sup:`3`), the volume of region 2 is 37 cm\ :sup:`3`
(64 - 27), and the volume of region 3 is 61 cm\ :sup:`3` (125 - 64).

The second table contains (1) the unit number, (2) the number of times
the unit is used in the problem, (3) the region number within the unit,
(4) the mixture number present in the region, and (5) the total volume
associated with the region in the whole problem. The unit number is
printed under the heading UNIT, data printed under the heading USES
indicates the number of times the unit is used in the problem. Data
printed under the heading MIXTURE indicates the mixture number used in
the region. The total volume of each region is printed under the heading
TOTAL VOLUME and is determined by multiplying the VOLUME of the region
listed in the first table by the number of times the unit containing
that region is used in the problem.

The third table is printed following the heading “TOTAL MIXTURE
VOLUMES.” In this table, the mixtures used in the problem are listed
with their associated total volume and total mass. The mixture numbers
are printed under the heading MIXTURE, the total volume of each mixture
is printed under the heading TOTAL VOLUME, and the mass of each mixture
is printed under the heading MASS(G). All masses will be printed as zero
if the working format cross section library does not contain the data
required to calculate the densities of the mixtures used in the problem.

Two tables of volumes are printed by subroutine VOLUME and cannot be
suppressed. If a volume calculation type of NONE is specified and no
volumes are read in for the regions, then the volumes will be set to
−1.0, which will result in negative fluxes and fission densities. For
the calculated volumes, an error estimate is printed after the volumes.
The first table will list the number of times each unit is used in the
problem and the total volume of each region throughout the entire
problem description. The second table will list the total volume and
mass of each mixture used in the problem. An example of the volume

The unit number is printed under the heading **UNIT**. The REGION refers
to the number of the geometry region within the unit determined by the
order of the CONTENT records in the unit. USES indicates the number of
times the unit is used in the problem. MIXTURE is the mixture number
used in the region. A blank indicates an array or unit, placed in a
hole, in that region. TOTAL VOLUME is the total volume of that region
followed by +/− and an error estimate if the volume for the region was
calculated.

If mesh volumes are used, there will be a table listing the cumulative
volumes generated by summing the mesh volumes, the deviations, and the
deltas between the summed volumes and the overall volumes for the
regions. If the overall volume has been calculated, then the delta
should be zero, but if it was entered, then the delta will show the
difference.

In the last table, the mixtures used in the problem are listed along

Mesh volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the mesh flux accumulator, fluxes are tabulated for each region of
each unit in a cuboidal mesh. KENO computes the volume of each region in
each mesh interval so that fluxes per unit volume can be determined. For
models where the mesh flux accumulator is activated by setting
**MFX**\ =YES and the mesh size set to a positive value with **MSH**\ =,
the cumulative volume of all mesh intervals for a given region and the
number of meshes used in each region are printed as shown in :numref:`list8-1-33`.

An optional edit of volumes for each mesh interval for each region can
be activated by entering **PMV**\ =YES in the parameter input. This edit
can be very large, especially if a small mesh size is used with a large
model. A sample of the volume by mesh for each region is shown in :numref:`list8-1-34`.

printed at the top of the column corresponds to the BIAS ID used in the
geometry region description or MEDIA record and printed in the biasing
information.

Plot representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plots representing 2-D slices through the geometrical description of the
problem are optional. They are created if plot data are entered unless
**PLT**\ =NO is specified either in the plot data or the parameter data.
Plots can be generated and displayed as (1) character plots with
alphanumeric characters representing mixture numbers, unit numbers, or
bias ID numbers or (2) color plots with colors representing mixture
numbers, unit numbers, or bias ID numbers. Color plots generate a PNG
file and require an independent program to be displayed.

An example of the output generated using the character plot method is
given in :numref:`list8-1-37` and :numref:`list8-1-38`. An example of the output generated using the color plot
method is given in :numref:`list8-1-39` and :numref:`fig8-1-121`.

:numref:`list8-1-37` summarizes the data used to generate the character plot. :numref:`list8-1-38` is an example
of a character plot of the 2-D slice specified through the geometrical
description of the problem. In :numref:`list8-1-37`, the plot title is printed at the top of
the page, followed by a statement that “THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A
CHARACTER PLOT.” If a plot title was not entered in the plot data, the
plot title is defaulted to the problem title. The title is followed by a
heading specifying the type of plot (MIXTURE MAP, BIAS ID MAP, or UNIT
MAP). This is followed by a table that correlates the symbols to be used
in the character plot with the mixture numbers, bias ID numbers, or unit
numbers that were used in the problem. If the problem is a bare array,
the overall system coordinates are printed. Then the coordinates of the
upper left corner and lower right corner of the plot are printed. This
is followed by the direction cosines down and across the plot. The
remaining plot parameters (including both input data and calculated
values) are then printed. NU is the number of characters printed in the
U (down) direction, NV is the number of characters printed in the V
(across) direction, DELU is the incremental distance, in cm, represented
by each character in the U (down) direction, DELV is the incremental
distance, in cm, represented by each character in the V (across)
direction, and LPI is the vertical to horizontal scaling factor for plot
proportionality.

:numref:`list8-1-38` shows a character plot of a 2-D slice specified through the
geometrical description of the problem. These plots aid the user in
verifying that the problem is described correctly. Any number of plots
can be made in one problem.

:numref:`list8-1-39` summarizes the data used to generate the color plot.
:numref:`fig8-1-121` is an example of a color plot of the 2-D slice specified
through the geometrical description of the problem. This plot does not
appear in the KENO printout. It is generated from a PNG file that is
created when a color plot has been specified in the KENO input data and
requires special processing by the user.

In :numref:`fig8-1-121`, the plot title is printed at the top of the page,
followed by a statement that “THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A COLOR PLOT.” If a
plot title was not entered in the plot data, the plot title is defaulted
to the problem title. The title is followed by a heading specifying the
type of plot (MIXTURE MAP, BIAD ID MAP, or UNIT MAP). If the problem is
a bare array, the overall system coordinates are printed. Then the
coordinates of the upper left corner and lower right corner of the plot
are printed. This is followed by the direction cosines down and across
the plot. The remaining plot parameters (including both input data and
calculated values) are then printed. NU is the number of characters
printed in the U (down) direction, NV is the number of characters
printed in the V (across) direction, DELU is the incremental distance,
in cm, represented by each character in the U (down) direction, DELV is
the incremental distance, in cm, represented by each character in the V
(across) direction, and LPI is the vertical to horizontal scaling factor
for plot proportionality.
