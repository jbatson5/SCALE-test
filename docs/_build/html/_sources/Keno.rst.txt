KENO is a three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo criticality transport
program developed and maintained for use as part of the SCALE Code
System. It can be used as part of a sequence or as a standalone program.
There are two versions of the code currently supported in SCALE.
KENO V.a is the older of the two. KENO-VI contains all current KENO V.a
features plus a more flexible geometry package known as the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package. The geometry package in KENO-VI is capable
of modeling any volume that can be constructed using quadratic
equations. In addition, such features as geometry intersections, body
rotations, hexagonal and dodecahedral arrays, and array boundaries have
been included to make the code more flexible.

The simpler geometry features supported by KENO V.a allow for
significantly shorter execution times than KENO-VI, while the additional
geometry features supported in KENO-VI make the code appropriate for
cases where geometry modeling is not possible with KENO V.a. In
particular, KENO-VI allows intersections, body truncations with planes,
and a much wider variety of geometrical bodies. KENO-VI also has the
ability to rotate bodies so that volumes no longer must be positioned
parallel to a major axis. Hexagonal arrays are available in KENO-VI and
dohecahedral arrays enable the code to model pebble bed reactors and
other systems composed of close packed spheres. The use of array
boundaries makes it possible to fill a non-cuboidal volume with an
array, specifying the boundary where a particle leaves and enters the
array.

Except for geometry capabilities, the two versions of KENO share most of
the computational capabilities and the input flexibility specific to
most SCALE modules. They can both operate in multigroup or continuous
energy mode, run as standalone codes, or integrated in computational
sequences such as CSAS, TSUNAMI-3D, or TRITON. Both versions of the code
are continually updated and are written in FORTRAN 90.

Computational capabilities shared by the two versions of KENO include
the determination of k‑effective, neutron lifetime, generation time,
energy-dependent leakages, energy- and region-dependent absorptions,
fissions, the system mean-free-path, the region-dependent
mean-free-path, average neutron energy, flux densities, fission
densities, reaction rate tallies, mesh tallies, source convergence
diagnostics, problem-dependent continuous energy temperature treatments,
parallel calculations, restart capabilities, and many more.

Introduction to KENO
--------------------

KENO, a functional module in the SCALE system, is a Monte Carlo
criticality program used to calculate :math:`k_{eff}`, fluxes, reaction rates,
and other data for three-dimensional (3-D) systems. Special features
include multigroup or continuous energy mode, simplified data input, the
ability to specify origins for spherical and cylindrical geometry
regions, a P\ :sub:`n` scattering treatment, and restart capability.

The KENO data input features flexibility in the order of input. The only
restrictions are that the sequence identifier, title, and cross section
library must be entered first. A large portion of the data has been
assigned default values found to be adequate for many
problems. This feature enables the user to run a problem with a minimum
of input data.

In addition to the features listed above, KENO-VI uses the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package (SGGP), which contains a much larger set of
geometrical bodies, including cuboids, cylinders, spheres, cones,
dodecahedrons, elliptical cylinders, ellipsoids, hoppers,
parallelepipeds, planes, rhomboids, and wedges. The code’s flexibility
is increased by allowing: intersecting geometry regions; hexagonal,
dodecahedral, and cuboidal arrays; bodies and holes rotated to any angle
and translated to any position; and a specified array boundary that
contains only that portion of the array located inside the boundary.
Users should be aware that the added geometry features in KENO‑VI can
result in significantly longer run times than KENO V.a. A KENO-VI
problem that can be modeled in KENO V.a will typically run about four
times as long with KENO-VI as it does with KENO V.a. Therefore KENO-VI
is not a replacement for KENO V.a, but rather an additional version for
more complex geometries that could not be modeled previously.

Blocks of input data are entered in the form

**READ XXXX** *input_data* **END XXXX,**

where **XXXX** is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
types of data entered include parameters, geometry region data, array
definition data, biasing or weighting data, albedo boundary conditions,
starting distribution information, the cross section mixing table, extra
one-dimensional (1-D) (reaction rate) cross section IDs for special
applications, energy group boundaries for tallying in the continuous
energy mode, a mesh grid for collecting flux moments, and printer plot
information.

A block of data can be omitted unless it is needed or desired for the
problem. Within the blocks of data, most of the input is activated by
using keywords to override default values.

The treatment of the energy variable can be either multigroup or
continuous. Changing the calculation mode from multigroup to continuous
energy or vice versa is established by simply changing the cross section
library used. All available calculated entities in the multigroup mode
can also be calculated in the continuous energy mode. If the calculated
entity is energy or group dependent, it is automatically tallied into
the appropriate group structure in the continuous energy mode.

The KENO V.a geometry input consists of spheres, hemispheres, cylinders,
hemicylinders, and cuboids. Although the origin of the cylinders,
hemicylinders, spheres, and hemispheres is zero by default, they may be
specified to any value that will allow the geometry to fit in the
problem. This feature allows the use of nonconcentric cylindrical and
spherical shapes and provides a great deal of freedom in positioning
them. Another feature that expands the generality of the code is the
ability to place the cut surface of the hemicylinders and hemispheres at
any distance between the radius and the origin.

An additional convenience is the availability of an alternative method
for specifying the array definition unit-location data. This method uses
FIDO-like options for filling the array.

As mentioned above, KENO-VI uses the SGGP, which contains a much more
flexible geometry package than the one in KENO V.a. In KENO-VI, geometry
regions are constructed and processed as sets of quadratic equations. A
set of geometric shapes (including all of those used in KENO V.a plus
others) is available in KENO-VI, as well as the ability to build more
complex geometric shapes using sets of quadratic equations. Unlike
KENO V.a, KENO-VI allows intersections between geometry regions within a
unit, and it provides the ability to specify an array boundary that
intersects the array.

The most flexible KENO V.a geometry features are the
“\ **ARRAY**-of-**ARRAY**\ s” and “\ **HOLE**\ s” capabilities. The
**ARRAY**-of-**ARRAY**\ s option allows the construction of **ARRAY**\ s
from other **ARRAY**\ s. The depth of nesting is limited only by
computer space restrictions. This option greatly simplifies the setup
for **ARRAY**\ s involving different **UNIT**\ s at different spacings.
The **HOLE** option allows a **UNIT** or an **ARRAY** to be placed at
any desired location within a geometry region. The emplaced **UNIT** or
**ARRAY** cannot intersect any geometry region and must be wholly
contained within a region. As many **HOLE**\ s as will snugly fit
without intersecting can be placed in a region. This option is
especially useful for describing shipping casks and reflectors that have
gaps or other geometrical features. Any number of **HOLE**\ s can be
described in a problem, and **HOLE**\ s can be nested to any depth.

The primary difference between the KENO V.a and KENO-VI geometry input
is the methodology used to represent the geometry/material regions in a
unit. KENO-VI uses two geometry records (cards) to describe a region.
The first record, called the GEOMETRY record, contains the geometry
(**shape**) keyword, region boundary definitions, and any geometry
modification data. Using geometry modification data, regions can be
rotated and translated to any angle and position within a unit. The
second record, the **CONTENT** record, contains the **MEDIA** keyword;
the material, **HOLE**, or **ARRAY** ID number; the bias ID number; and
the region definition vector. KENO-VI requires that a **GLOBAL UNIT** be
specified in all problems, including single unit problems.

In addition to the *cuboidal* **ARRAY**\ s available in KENO V.a,
*hexagonal* **ARRAY**\ s and *dodecahedral* **ARRAY**\ s can be directly
constructed in KENO-VI. Also, the ability to specify an **ARRAY**
boundary that intersects the **ARRAY** makes it possible to construct a
lattice in a cylinder using one **ARRAY** in KENO-VI instead of multiple
**ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s as would be required in KENO V.a.

Anisotropic scattering is treated by using discrete scattering angles.
The angles and associated probabilities are generated in a manner that
preserves the moments of the angular scattering distribution for the
selected group-to-group transfer. These moments can be derived from the
coefficients of a P\ :sub:`n` Legendre polynomial expansion. All moments
through the 2n − 1 moment are preserved for n discrete scattering
angles. A one-to-one correspondence exists such that n Legendre
coefficients yield n moments. The cases of zero and one scattering angle
are treated in a special manner. Even when the user specifies multiple
scattering angles, KENO can recognize that the distribution is
isotropic, and therefore KENO selects from a continuous isotropic
distribution. If the user specifies one scattering angle, the code
selects the scattering angle from a linear function if it is positive
between -1 and +1, and otherwise it performs semicontinuous scattering
by picking scattering angle cosines uniformly over some range between –1
and +1. The probability is zero over the rest of the range.

The KENO restart option is easy to activate. Certain changes can be made
when a problem is restarted, including using a different random sequence
or turning off certain print options such as fluxes or the fissions and
absorptions by region.

KENO can also compute angular fluxes and flux moments in multigroup
calculations, which are required to compute scattering terms for
generation of sensitivity coefficients with the SAMS module or the
TSUNAMI-3D control module. Fluxes can also be accumulated in a Cartesian
mesh that is superimposed over the user-defined geometry in an automated
manner.

KENO can perform Monte Carlo transport calculations concurrently on a
number of computational nodes. By introducing a simple master-slave
approach via MPI, KENO runs different random walks concurrently on the
replicated geometry within the same generation. Fission source and other
tallied quantities are gathered at the end of each generation by the
master process and are then processed either for final edits or
subsequent generations. Code parallel performance is strongly dependent
on the size of the problem simulated and the size of the tallied
quantities.

KENO Data Guide
---------------

KENO may be run stand alone or as part of a SCALE criticality safety or
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sequence. If KENO is run stand
alone in the multigroup mode, cross section data can be used from an
AMPX :cite:`dunn_ampx-2000_2002` working format library or from a Monte Carlo format cross
section library. If KENO uses an AMPX working format library, a mixing
table data block must be entered. If a Monte Carlo format library is
used, a mixing table data block is not entered, and the mixtures
specified in the KENO geometry description must be consistent with the
mixtures created on the Monte Carlo format library file.

If KENO is run stand alone in the continuous energy mode, a mixing table
data block must be provided unless the restart option is used.

If KENO is run as part of a SCALE criticality safety or sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis sequence, the mixtures are defined in the CSAS or
TSUNAMI-3D input, and a mixing table data block cannot be entered in
KENO. Furthermore, the mixture numbers used in the KENO geometry
description must correspond to those defined in the composition data
block of the CSAS or TSUNAMI-3D input. To use a cell-weighted mixture in
KENO, the keyword “\ **CELLMIX**\ =,” followed by a unique mixture
number, must be specified in the unit cell data of the CSAS or
TSUNAMI‑3D sequence. Unit cell data are applicable only in the
multigroup mode. The mixture number used in the KENO input is the unique
mixture number immediately following the keyword “\ **CELLMIX**\ =.” A
cell‑weighted mixture is available only in SCALE sequences that use
XSDRN to perform a cell-weighting calculation using a multigroup cross
section library. :numref:`tab8-1-1` through :numref:`tab8-1-14` summarize the KENO
input data blocks. These input data blocks are discussed in detail in
the following sections.

In order to run KENO parallel (standalone execution), the user must
provide a name with the “%” prefix in the input file (=%kenovi). Control
modules like CSAS, TRITON, and TSUNAMI-3D automatically initiate
parallel KENO execution if the user provides the required arguments
while running this code.

Keno input outline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data input for KENO is outlined below. Default data for KENO have
been found to be adequate for many problems. These values should be
carefully considered when entering data.

Blocks of input data are entered in the form:

**READ XXXX** *input_data* **END XXXX**

where **XXXX** is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
keywords that can be used are listed in Table 8.1.15. A minimum of four
characters is required for a keyword, and some keyword names may be as
long as twelve characters (**READ PARAMETER**, **READ GEOMETRY**, etc.).
Keyword inputs are not case sensitive. Data input is activated by
entering the words **READ XXXX** followed by one or more blanks. All
input data pertinent to **XXXX** are then entered. Data for **XXXX** are
terminated by entering **END XXXX** followed by two or more blanks. Note
that multiple **READ GRID** blocks are used if multiple grid definitions
are needed.

Three data records **must** be entered for every problem: first the
SCALE sequence identifier, then the problem title, and then the **END
DATA** to terminate the problem.

(1) KENO is typically run using one of the SCALE CSAS or TSUNAMI
sequences, but it may also be run stand alone using KENO V.a or KENO-VI.
The sequence identifier is specified using one line similar to:

=kenovi

This line may also include additional runtime directives that are
described throughout the SCALE manual. For example:

=kenova parm=check

The following guidance generally assumes the user is running KENO stand
alone. If KENO is to be run using of the other sequences (e.g., CSAS5),
see the appropriate manual section for additional guidance.

(2) **problem title**

   Enter a problem title (limit 80 characters, including blanks; extra
   characters will be discarded). A title **must be entered**.
   See Sect. 8.1.2.3.

(3) **READ PARA** *parameter_data* **END PARA**

   Enter parameter input as needed to describe a problem. If parameter
   data are desired in standalone KENO calculations (i.e., non-CSAS),
   they must immediately follow the problem title. Default values are
   assigned to all parameters. A problem **can** be run without entering
   any parameter data if the default values are acceptable.

   Parameter data must begin with the words **READ PARA**, **READ
   PARM**, or **READ PARAMETER.** Parameter data may be entered in any
   order. If a parameter is entered more than once, the last value is
   used. The words **END PARA** or **END PARM**, or **END PARAMETER**
   terminate the parameter data. See :ref:`8-1-2-3`.

(n\ :sub:`1`)...( n\ :sub:`13`) The following data may be entered in any
order. Data not needed to describe the problem may be omitted.

(n\ :sub:`1`) **READ GEOM** *all_geometry_region_data* **END GEOM**

Geometry region data must be entered for every problem that is not a
restart problem. Geometry data must begin with the words **READ GEOM**
or **READ GEOMETRY**. The words **END GEOM** or **END GEOMETRY**
terminate the geometry region data. See :ref:`8-1-2-4`.

(n\ :sub:`2`) **READ ARRA** *array_definition_data* **END ARRA**

   Enter array definition data as needed to describe the problem. Array
   definition data define the array size and position units (defined in
   the geometry data) in a 3-D lattice that represents the physical
   problem being analyzed. Array data must begin with the words **READ
   ARRA** or **READ ARRAY** and must terminate with the words **END
   ARRA** or **END ARRAY**. See :ref:`8-1-2-5`.

(n\ :sub:`4`) **READ BOUN** *albedo_boundary_conditions* **END BOUN**

   Enter albedo boundary conditions as needed to describe the problem.
   Albedo data must begin with the words **READ BOUN, READ BNDS**,
   **READ BOUND**, or **READ BOUNDS,** and it must terminate with the
   words **END BOUN**, **ENDS BNDS**, **END BOUND**, or **END BOUNDS**.
   See :ref:`8-1-2-6`.

(n\ :sub:`3`) **READ BIAS** *biasing_information* **END BIAS**

   The *biasing_information* is used to define the weight given to a
   neutron surviving Russian roulette. Biasing data must begin with the
   words **READ BIAS**. The words **END BIAS** terminate the biasing
   data. See :ref:`8-1-2-7`.

(n\ :sub:`5`) **READ STAR** *starting_distribution_information* **END
STAR**

   Enter starting information data for starting the initial source
   neutrons only if a uniform starting distribution is undesirable.
   Start data must begin with the words **READ STAR, READ STRT** or
   **READ START**, and it must terminate with the words **END STAR**,
   **END STRT** or **END START**. See :ref:`8-1-2-8`.

(n\ :sub:`6`) **READ ENER** *energy_group_boundaries* **END ENER**

   Enter upper energy boundaries for each neutron energy group to be
   used for tallying in the continuous energy mode. Energy bin data
   begin with the words **READ ENER** or **READ ENERGY** and terminate
   with the words **END ENER** or **END ENERGY**. The last entry is the
   lower energy boundary of the last group. The values must be in
   descending order. This block is only applicable to continuous energy
   KENO calculations. See :ref:`8-1-2-12`.

(n\ :sub:`7`) **READ MIXT** *cross_section_mixing_table* **END MIXT**

   Enter a mixing table to define all the mixtures to be used in the
   problem. The mixing table must begin with the words **READ MIXT** or
   **READ MIX** and must end with the words **END MIXT** or **END MIX**.

Procedure for data input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a standalone KENO problem, the first data records **must** be the
sequence identifier (e.g., =kenovi or =kenova) and the title. The next
block of data **must** be the parameters if they are to be entered. A
problem can be run without entering the parameters, which causes KENO to
use default values for input parameters. The remaining blocks of data
can be entered in any order.

   **BOLD TYPE** specifies keywords. A keyword is used to identify the
   data that follow it. When a keyword is used, it must be entered
   exactly as shown in the data guide. All keywords except those ending
   with an equal sign must be followed by at least one blank.

   *small_italics* correlate data with a program variable name. The
   actual values are entered in place of the program variable name and
   are terminated by a blank or a comma.

   *CAPITAL ITALICS* identify general data items. General data items are
   general classes of data including

   (1) geometry data such as *UNIT INITIALIZATION* and *UNIT NUMBER
   DEFINITION, GEOMETRY REGION DESCRIPTION, GEOMETRY WORD, MIXTURE
   NUMBER, BIAS ID,* and *REGION DIMENSIONS*,

   (2) albedo data such as *FACE CODES* and *ALBEDO NAMES*,

(3) weighting data such as *BIAS ID NUMBERS*, etc.

   Square brackets The square brackets, [ and ], are used to show that
   an entry is optional.

   Broken line The broken line, \|, is used as a logical “or” symbol to
   show that the entries to its left and right are alternatives that
   cannot be used simultaneously.

Title and parameter data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *title*, a character string, must be entered at the top of the input
file. The syntax is:

*title* a string of characters with a length of up to 80 characters,
including blanks.

The **PARAMETER** block may contain parameter initializations for those
parameters that need to be changed from their default value. The syntax
for the **PARAMETER** block is:

**READ** **PARA**\ [**METER**] *p\ 1 … p\ N* **END**
**PARA**\ [**METER**]

or

**READ** **PARM** *p\ 1 … p\ N* **END** **PARM**

*p\ 1 … p\ N* are *N* (*N* greater than or equal to zero) keyworded
parameters that together make up the *PARAMETER DATA*

The commonly changed parameters are **TME**\ *,* **GEN**\ *,* **NSK**,
and **NPG**. Seldom changed parameters are **NBK**\ *,* **NFB**\ *,*
**XNB**\ *,* **XFB**\ *,* **WTH**\ *,* **WTL**\ *,* **TBA**\ *,*
**BUG**\ *,* **TRK**\ *,* and **LNG**.

  0.0 (no limit).

  **TBA** = *tbtch* time allotted for each generation (in minutes),
  default = 10 minutes. If *tbtch* is exceeded in any generation, the
  problem is assumed to be looping. Execution is terminated, and final
  edits are performed. The problem can loop indefinitely on a computer if
  the system-dependent routine to interrupt the problem (PULL) is not
  functional. **TBA=** is also used to set the amount of time available
  for generating the initial starting points.

  **SIG** = *tsigma* if entered and > 0.0, this is the standard deviation
  at which the problem will terminate, default = 0.0, which means do not
  check sigma.

  **WTA** = *dwtav* the default average weight given a neutron that
  survives Russian roulette, *dwtav* default = 0.5.

  **WTH** = *wthigh* the default value of *wthigh* is 3.0 and should be

  which splitting occurs is defined to be *wthigh x wtavg*, where *wtavg*
  is the weight given to a neutron that survives Russian roulette.

  **WTL** = *wtlow* Russian roulette is played when the weight of a
  neutron is less than *wtlow x wtavg*. The *wtlow* default =
  1.0/\ *wthigh*.

  **MSH** = *mesh_size* Length (cm) of one side of a cubic mesh for
  tallying fluxes. Default = 0.0. A positive non-zero value must be
  entered if **MFX**\ =YES and **READ GRID** input is not entered.

  **TTL =** *temperature_tolerance* The continuous energy cross sections
  must be within the *temperature_tolerance* (in degrees Kelvin) of the

  0, which means do not collect. Angular fluxes are typically only needed
  for TSUNAMI-3D calculations.

  **NGP** = *ngp* number of neutron energy groups to be used for tallying
  in the continuous energy mode. If *NGP* corresponds to a standard SCALE
  group structure, then the SCALE group structure will be used. If it does
  not correspond to a standard structure, an equally spaced in lethargy
  group structure will be used. If nothing is specified for a continuous
  energy problem, the SCALE 238 group structure will be used.

  **PNM** = *isctr* highest order of flux moment tallies, default = 0.
  Flux moments are typically only tallied for TSUNAMI-3D calculations.

     :sup:`239`\ Pu, :sup:`240`\ Pu)

  **DBX** = *db_xs_mode*

  option for performing problem-dependent or on-the-fly Doppler
  Broadening. See Sect. 8.1.6.2.10 for more details. Default = 2.

.. note:: The parameters RUN and PLOT can also be entered in the PLOT
  data. See Sect. 8.1.2.11. It is recommended that these parameters be
  entered only in the parameter data in order to ensure that the data
  printed in the Logical Parameters table is actually performed. If RUN
  and/or PLT are entered in both the parameter data and plot data, the
  results vary depending on whether the problem is run (1) stand alone,
  (2) as a restarted problem, (3) as CSAS with parm=check, or (4) as CSAS
  without parm=check. These conditions are detailed below.

KENO standalone and CSAS with PARM=CHECK
  The values of RUN and/or PLT entered in KENO parameter data are printed in the Logical Parameters table of the problem output. However, values for RUN and/or PLT entered in the **KENO plot data** will override the values entered in the parameter data.

Restarted KENO
  The values of RUN and/or PLT printed in the Logical Parameters table of the problem output are the final values from the parent problem unless those values are overridden by values entered in the **KENO parameter data** of the restarted problem. If the problem is restarted at generation 1, **KENO plot data** can be entered, and the values for RUN and/or PLT will override the values printed in the Logical Parameters table.

CSAS Without PARM=CHECK
  The values of RUN and/or PLT entered in the KENO parameter data override values entered in the KENO plot data. The values printed in the Logical Parameters table control whether the problem is to be executed and whether a plot is performed.

Parameters that are either Integer or Logical

**SCD**\ = *lScnvgDiag* enable fission source convergence diagnostics
(ScnvgDiag), default=YES. See Sect. 8.1.6.7for further details.

**CDS** = *lcadis/lGridFissions* accumulate neutron fissions to use as
fission source in subsequent MAVRIC/Monaco shielding calculation or for
visualization, default = NO

**GFX** = *lGridFlux* compute grid fluxes averaged over the volume of
the mesh on intervals defined by a READ GRID data block, default = NO.

**MFX** = *lMeshFlux* compute mesh fluxes averaged over the volume of
mixtures/materials in a mesh on intervals defined by **MSH** above or by
READ GRID data block, default = NO.

**CGD** = *lStarMesh* grid ID for the *F*\ :sup:`\*`\ (r) mesh for
continuous energy CLUTCH sensitivity calculations. This mesh is defined
in the **READ GRID** data block, default = NO.

.. note::  The KENO codes in previous SCALE versions allowed for only one
  mesh definition in the user input with either MSH parameter or **READ
  GRID** data block, and (2) calculation of a single mesh-based quantity,
  such as **MFX** (mesh fluxes) or **CDS** (fission source accumulation on
  a mesh), per KENO simulation.

  The option to define multiple spatial meshes during a single simulation
  has been implemented in the KENO codes to add flexibility to mesh-based
  quantity calculations. The new implementation requires that each mesh
  definition in the **READ GRID** block should have a unique NUMBER (grid
  ID), which is used for mesh assignment. Users can assign any number of
  mesh-based quantities by setting the mesh parameters **SCD**, **CDS**,
  **GFX**, **MFX** and **CGD** to this grid NUMBER.

  To support these former and new definition formats, the parameters
  **SCD**, **CDS**, **GFX**, **MFX** and **CGD** have been redesigned to
  allow either integer or logical entries. Integer entries are required if
  multiple mesh-based quantities are requested by the user. In this case,
  each integer entry must point to a grid ID specified in any **READ
  GRID** data block. See Sect. 8.1.2.14. for several examples for the use
  of these parameter definitions. These entries are detailed below.

   **SCD**\ =yes Enable source convergence diagnostics using the fission
   source accumulation on the default mesh, which is 5 × 5 × 5 Cartesian
   mesh overlaying the whole problem geometry, generated automatically.
   See Sect. 8.1.6.7.

   **SCD**\ =\ *id* Enable source convergence diagnostics using the
   fission source accumulation on the mesh defined with **READ GRID**
   data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **MFX**\ =yes Compute mesh fluxes (fluxes averaged over each region
   volume in a voxel) on intervals defined by **MSH** above or by the
   first specified **READ GRID** data block.

   **MFX**\ =\ *id* Compute mesh fluxes on intervals defined by the
   **READ GRID** data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **CDS**\ =yes Accumulate fission sources on intervals defined by the
   first specified **READ GRID** data block.

   **CDS**\ =\ *id* Accumulate fission source on intervals defined by
   the specified **READ GRID** data block with grid ID, *id*.

   **GFX**\ =\ *id* Compute grid fluxes (fluxes averaged over a voxel
   volume) on intervals defined by the READ GRID data block with grid
   ID, *id*.

   **CGD**\ =\ *id* Enable a mesh grid defined by the READ GRID data
   block with grid ID, id for CLUTCH :math:`F^{*}\left( r \right)`
   calculations.

   All of the above quantities may be requested in a single input using
   either the same or different grids. See Sect. 8.1.2.14 for further
   details.

I/O Unit Numbers

  **XSC** = *xsecs* I/O unit number for a Monte Carlo format mixed cross
  section library. When LIB≠0, default = 14. To read a mixed cross section
  library from a Monte Carlo format library file or CSASI, XSC must be
  specified.

  **ALB** = *albdo* I/O unit number for albedo data, default = 79.

  **WTS** = *wts* I/O unit number for weights, default = 80.

  **LIB** = *lib* I/O unit number for *AMPX* working format cross section
  library, default = 0.

  **SKT** = *skrt* I/O unit number for scratch space, default = 16.

  **RST** = *rstrt* I/O unit number for reading restart data, default = 0.

  Enter a logical unit number to restart if *BEG* > 1.

  **WRS** = *wstrt* I/O unit number for writing restart data, default = 0.

     A non-zero value must be entered if *RES* > 0.

  **GRP** = *grpbs* I/O unit number for an energy group boundary library,
  default = 77.

Geometry data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *GEOMETRY\_ DATA* consists of a series of **UNIT** descriptions, one
of which may be the **GLOBAL UNIT**. The **UNIT** is the basic geometry
piece in KENO and often corresponds to a well-defined physical entity
(e.g., a fuel pin). A **UNIT**, therefore, may consist of multiple
*material regions*. Each **UNIT** has its own, local coordinate system.
The **UNIT**\ s are assembled to construct the problem’s global geometry
for KENO. The *GEOMETRY\_ DATA* must be entered unless the problem is
being restarted. See :ref:`8-1-3-6` for detailed examples.

.. _8-1-2-4-1:

UNITS
^^^^^

Geometric arrangements in KENO are achieved in a manner similar to using
a child’s building blocks. Each building block is called a **UNIT**. An
**ARRAY** or lattice is constructed by stacking these **UNIT**\ s. Once
an **ARRAY** or lattice has been constructed, it can be placed in a
**UNIT** by using an **ARRAY** specification.

Each **UNIT** in an **ARRAY** or lattice has its own coordinate system.
In KENO V.a, all coordinate systems in all **UNIT**\ s must have the
same orientation. This restriction is removed in KENO-VI. All geometry
data used in a problem are correlated to the absolute coordinate system
by specifying a **GLOBAL UNIT**. **UNIT**\ s are constructed of
combinations from several allowed **shape**\ s or geometric regions.
These regions can be placed anywhere within a **UNIT**. In KENO V.a the
regions are oriented along the coordinate system of the **UNIT** and do
not intersect other regions. This means, for example, that a
**CYLINDER** must have its axis parallel to one of the coordinate axes,
while a rectangular parallelepiped must have its faces perpendicular to
a coordinate axis. The most stringent KENO V.a geometry restriction is
that none of the options allow geometry regions to intersect. In KENO
V.a, each region in a unit must entirely contain each preceding region.
The orientation, intersection, and containment restrictions are
eliminated in KENO-VI. :numref:`fig8-1-1` shows some situations that are not
allowed in KENO V.a, but are allowed in KENO-VI.

.. _fig8-1-1:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig1.png
  :align: center

  Examples of geometry allowed in KENO-VI but not allowed in KENO V.a.

For KENO V.a, unless special options are invoked, each geometric region
in a **UNIT** must completely enclose each interior region. Regions may
touch at points of tangency and may share faces. See :numref:`fig8-1-2` for
examples of allowable situations.

.. _fig8-1-2:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig2.png
  :align: center

  Examples of correct KENO V.a units.

Special options are provided to circumvent the complete enclosure
restriction in KENO V.a or to enhance the basic geometry package in
KENO-VI. These options include **ARRAY** and **HOLE** descriptions. The
**HOLE** option is the simplest of these and allows placing a **UNIT**
anywhere within a region of another **UNIT.** In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s
are not allowed to intersect the region into which they are placed; this
restriction does not apply in KENO-VI (see :numref:`fig8-1-3`). In both geometry
packages, a **HOLE** cannot intersect the **UNIT** boundary. It is
recommended that the outer boundary of a **UNIT** used as a **HOLE**
should not be tangent to or share a boundary with another **HOLE** or a
region of the **UNIT** containing the **HOLE** because the code may find
that the regions are intersecting due to precision and round-off. Since
a particle must check every region to determine its location within a
**UNIT**, using **HOLE**\ s to contain complex sections of a problem may
decrease the CPU time needed for the problem in KENO-VI. Inclusion of
**HOLE**\ s increases run-time in KENO V.a, but in many cases cannot be
avoided. An arbitrary number of **HOLE**\ s can be placed in a region in
combination with a series of surrounding regions. The only restrictions
on **HOLE**\ s are (1) when they are placed in a **UNIT,** they must be
entirely contained within the **UNIT**, and (2) they cannot intersect
other **HOLE**\ s or nested **ARRAY**\ s. **HOLE**\ s in KENO V.a cannot
intersect an **ARRAY**; in KENO-VI, the **HOLE** cannot intersect the
**ARRAY** boundary.

  Example demonstrating HOLE capability in KENO.

Lattices or arrays are created by stacking **UNIT**\ s. In KENO V.a,
only rectangular parallelepipeds can be organized in an **ARRAY**.
**HEXPRISM**\ s and **DODECAHEDRON**\ s are allowed in KENO-VI to
construct triangular pitched or closed-packed dodecahedral **ARRAY**\ s,
respectively. The adjacent faces of adjacent **UNIT**\ s stacked in this
manner must match exactly. See :ref:`8-1-3-6-4` for additional
clarification and :numref:`fig8-1-4` and :numref:`fig8-1-5` for typical examples.

  :align: center

  Example of ARRAY construction.

The **ARRAY** option is provided to allow for placing an **ARRAY** or
lattice within a **UNIT**. In KENO-VI, an **ARRAY** is placed in a
**UNIT** by inserting it directly into a geometry/material region as a
content record. In KENO V.a, the **ARRAY** is placed directly in the
unit like a **CUBOID**: it must be the first region in the **UNIT**, or
the **ARRAY** elements must intersect with the smaller region.
Subsequent regions in the **UNIT** containing the **ARRAY** must contain
it entirely. In KENO-VI, the reverse is true: the region boundary
containing the **ARRAY** must coincide with or be contained within the
**ARRAY** boundary. Therefore, in KENO-VI the region boundary becomes
the **ARRAY** boundary, with the problem ignoring any part of the
**ARRAY** outside the boundary. A particle enters or leaves the
**ARRAY** when the region boundary is crossed. In KENO V.a, only one
**ARRAY** can be placed directly in a UNIT. However, multiple
**ARRAY**\ s can be placed within a **UNIT** by using **HOLE**\ s. When
an **ARRAY** is placed in a **UNIT** via a **HOLE**, the **UNIT** that
contains the **ARRAY** (rather than the **ARRAY** itself) is placed in
the **UNIT**. **ARRAY**\ s of dissimilar **ARRAY**\ s can be created by
stacking **UNIT**\ s that contain **ARRAY**\ s. In KENO-VI, it is
possible to place multiple **ARRAY**\ s in a **UNIT** by placing them in
separate regions. Also in KENO-VI, using **HOLE**\ s to insert
**ARRAY**\ s allows the **ARRAY**\ s to be rotated when placed. See
:numref:`fig8-1-6` for an example of an **ARRAY** composed of **UNIT**\ s
containing **HOLE**\ s and **ARRAY**\ s.

UNIT initialization
...................

The description of a **UNIT** starts out with the **UNIT**
*INITIALIZATION* and is terminated by encountering another **UNIT**
*INITIALIZATION* or **END GEOM**.

The **UNIT** *INITIALIZATION* has the following format:

[**GLOBAL**] **UNIT** *u*

*u* is the identification number (positive integer) assigned to the
particular **UNIT**. It may be used later to reference a **UNIT**
previously constructed that the user wishes to place in a **HOLE**, or
it may be used in an **ARRAY** (see below for more details).

**GLOBAL** is an attribute that specifies that the respective **UNIT**
is the most comprehensive **UNIT** in the KENO problem to be solved, the
**UNIT** that includes all the other **UNIT**\ s and defines the overall
geometric boundaries of the problem. In general, a \ **GLOBAL UNIT**
must be entered for each problem.

   In KENO V.a, the **GLOBAL** specification is optional. If it is used,
   it can precede either a **UNIT** command or an **ARRAY**
   *PLACEMENT_DESCRIPTION*. If it is not entered and the problem does
   not contain **ARRAY** data, **UNIT** 1 is the default **GLOBAL
   UNIT**. If there is no **GLOBAL UNIT** specified and **UNIT** 1 is
   absent from the geometry description, an error message is printed. If
   the geometry description contains an **ARRAY**, KENO V.a defaults the
   global array to the array referenced by the last **ARRAY**
   *PLACEMENT_DESCRIPTION* that is not immediately preceded by a unit
   description. Otherwise, it is the largest array number specified in
   the array data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`).

Examples of initiating a **UNIT**:

1. Initiate input data for **UNIT** No. 6.

..

   **UNIT** 6

2. Initiate input data for the **GLOBAL UNIT** which is **UNIT** No. 4.

..

   **GLOBAL UNIT** 4

For each **UNIT**, the **UNIT**\ ’s *DESCRIPTION* follows the
**UNIT**\ ’s *INITIALIZATION*. The *DESCRIPTION* is realized by
combining the commands listed below. The basic principles for
constructing a **UNIT** are different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. A
brief discussion of these principles, together with a few examples, is
presented at the end of this section following the description of the
basic input used to build the geometry of a **UNIT**. The keywords that
may be used to define a **UNIT** in KENO are as follows:

**shape**

**COM=**

**HOLE**

**ARRAY**

**REPLICATE** (KENO V.a only)

**REFLECTOR** (KENO V.a only)

**MEDIA** (KENO-VI only)

**BOUNDARY** (KENO-VI only)

Shape
.....

**Shape** is a generic keyword used to describe a basic geometric shape
that may be used in building the geometry of a particular **UNIT**. The
general format varies between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, the
**shape** defines a region containing a material, so the user is
required to provide both a material and a *bias ID*. In KENO-VI the
**shape** is used strictly as a surface, which is later used to define
the mono-material regions (using the **MEDIA** card). The user is
therefore required to enter a label for this surface so that the
**shape** can be referenced later.

KENO V.a:

**shape** *m* *b* *d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` [*a*\ :sub:`1` …* [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

KENO-VI:

**shape** *l* *d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` [*a*\ :sub:`1` …* [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

**shape** is a generic keyword that describes a basic predefined KENO
shape (e.g., **CUBOID**, **CYLINDER**) that is used to build the
geometry of the **UNIT**. The predefined shapes differ between KENO V.a
and KENO-VI. See Appendix A for a description of the KENO V.a basic
shapes and Appendix B for the KENO-VI shapes.

*m* is the mixture number of the material (positive integer) that fills
the particular shape in KENO V.a **UNIT** description. A material number
of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present in the
volume defined by the **shape**).

*b* is the bias identification number (*bias ID*, a positive integer)
assigned to the particular region defined by the **shape** in the KENO
V.a **UNIT** description.

*l* is the label (positive integer) assigned to the particular **shape**
in the KENO-VI **UNIT** description. This label is used later to define
a certain mono-material region within the **UNIT**.

*d*\ :sub:`1` … *d*\ :sub:`N` represent the *N* dimensions (floating point numbers) that
define the particular **shape** (e.g., radius of a sphere or cylinder).
See Appendixes A and B for the particular value of *N* and how each
**shape** is described.

*a*\ :sub:`1` … *a*\ :sub:`M` are *M* optional *ATTRIBUTES* for the **shape**. The
attributes provide additional flexibility in the **shape** description.
The attributes that may be used with either KENO V.a or KENO-VI are
described below (see shape ATTRIBUTES).

shape ATTRIBUTES

The *ATTRIBUTES* that can be used to enhance the **shape** description
are **CHORD**, **ORIG**\ [**IN**], **CENTER**, and **ROTATE** (KENO-VI
only).

The CHORD attribute

This attribute has different formats in KENO V.a and KENO-VI. The user
will notice that it is more restrictive in KENO V.a. Only the
**HEMISPHERE and HEMICYLINDER shape**\ s can be **CHORD**\ ed in KENO
V.a, but all 3-D shapes may be **CHORD**\ ed in KENO-VI.

KENO V.a:
**CHORD** *ρ*

KENO-VI:
**CHORD** [**+X**\ =\ *x\ +*] [-**X**\ =\ *x\ -*] [**+Y**\ =\ *y\ +*]
[-**Y**\ =\ *y\ -*] [**+Z**\ =\ *z\ +*] [-**Z**\ =\ *z\ -*]

:math:`p`
  is the distance *ρ* from the cut surface to the center of the sphere
  or the axis of a hemicylinder. See :numref:`fig8-1-7` and :numref:`fig8-1-8`. Negative
  values of *ρ* indicate that less than half of the **shape** is retained,
  while positive values indicate that more than half of the **shape** will
  be retained.

**+X=**, -**X=**, **+Y=**, -**Y=**, **+Z=**, -**Z=**
  are subordinate
  keywords that define the axis parallel to the chord. The “+” and “-”
  signs are used to define the side of the chord which is included in the
  volume. A “+” in the keyword indicates that the more positive side of
  the chord is included in the volume. A “-” in the keyword indicates that
  the more negative side of the chord is included in the volume.

*x\ +, x\ -, y\ +, y\ -, z\ +, z\ -*
  are the coordinates of the plane
  perpendicular to the chord. For each chord added to a body, the keyword
  **CHORD** must be used, followed by one of the subordinate keywords and
  its dimension.

In KENO V.a, the CHORD attribute is applicable for only hemispherical
and hemicylindrical shapes, *not* for SPHERE, XCYLINDER, YCYLINDER,
CYLINDER, ZCYLINDER, CUBE, or CUBOID.

KENO-VI.

  Examples of the CHORD option in KENO-VI.

The ORIG\ [IN] attribute

The format is slightly different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. Since the
entries in KENO-VI are key worded, the user has more flexibility in
choosing the order of these entries or in using default values. Only
non-zero values must be entered in KENO-VI, but all applicable values,
whether zero or non-zero, must be entered in KENO V.a.

KENO V.a:
**ORIG**\ [**IN**] *a b* [*c*]

KENO-VI:
**ORIGIN** [**X**\ =\ *x*\ :sub:`0`] [**Y**\ =\ *y*\ :sub:`0`] [**Z**\ =\ *z*\ :sub:`0`]

:math:`a`
  is the X coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; the X
  coordinate of the centerline of a Z or Y cylinder or hemicylinder; the Y
  coordinate of the centerline of an X cylinder or hemicylinder.

:math:`b`
  is the Y coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; the Y
  coordinate of the centerline of a Z cylinder or hemicylinder; the Z
  coordinate of the centerline of an X or Y cylinder or hemicylinder.

:math:`c`
  is the Z coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; it must
  be omitted for all cylinders or hemicylinders.

**X=**, **Y=**, **Z=**
  are the subordinate keywords used to define the
  new position of the origin of the **shape**. If the a subordinate
  keyword appears more than once after the **ORIGIN** keyword, the values
  are summed. If the new value is zero, the particular coordinate does not
  need to be specified.

*x*\ :sub:`0`, *y*\ :sub:`0`, *z*\ :sub:`0`
  are the values for the new coordinates where the
  origin of the **shape** is to be translated.

The CENTER attribute

This attribute establishes the reference center for the flux moment
calculations, which can be useful in TSUNAMI calculations. The syntax
for this attribute is:

**CENTER** *center_type* [*u*] [*x y z*]

*center_type*
  is the reference center value, as described in
  :numref:`tab8-1-16`. The default value is **global**.

*u*
  is the **UNIT** number to be used as a reference center for this
  region when the *center_type* is **unit**.

*x*, *y*, *z*
  are the offset from the point specified by the
  *center_type*. The default is 0.0 for all three entries.

  +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+


The ROTATE attribute

This attribute can only be used in the KENO-VI input. It allows for the
rotation of the **shape** or **HOLE** to which it is applied. If
**ORIGIN** and **ROTATE** data follow the same **shape** or **HOLE**
record, the **shape** is always rotated prior to translation, regardless
of the order in which the data appear. Fig. 8.1.10 provides an example
of the use of the **ROTATE** option. Its syntax is:

**ROTATE** [**A1**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`1`] [**A2**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`2`] [**A3**\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`3`]

**A1**\ =, **A2**\ =, **A3**\ =
  are subordinate keywords to specify the
  angles of rotation of the particular shape with respect to the origin of
  the coordinate system. The Euler X-convention is used for rotation.

*a*\ :sub:`1`, *a*\ :sub:`2`, *a*\ :sub:`3`
  are the values of the Euler rotation angles in
  degrees. The default is 0 degrees. If a subordinate keyword appears more
  than once following the ROTATE keyword, the values are summed.

.. _fig8-1-10:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig10.png
  :align: center
  :width: 500

  Explanation of the ROTATE option.

Examples of **shape**\ s:

1. Specify a hemisphere labeled 10, containing material 2 with a radius
   of 5.0 cm which contains only material where Z > 2.0 within the
   sphere centered at the origin, and its origin translated to X=1.0,
   Y=1.5, and Z=3.0.
   KENO V.a (no label, but material and bias ID are the first two numerical entries):

   **HEMISPHERE** 2 1 5.0 **CHORD** -2.0 **ORIGIN** 1.0 1.5 3.0

   or

   **HEMISPHE+Z** 2 1 5.0 **CHORD** -2.0 **ORIGIN** 1.0 1.5 3.0

   KENO-VI (no material; this is to be specified with **MEDIA**):

   **SPHERE** 10 5.0 **CHORD** **+Z**\ =2.0 **ORIGIN** **X**\ =1.0
   **Y**\ =1.5 **Z**\ =3.0

2. Specify a hemicylinder labeled 10, containing material 1, having a
   radius of 5.0 cm and a length extending from Z=2.0 cm to Z=7.0 cm.
   The hemicylinder has been truncated perpendicular to the X axis at
   X= −3 such that material 1 does not exist between X= −3 and X= −5.
   Position the origin of the truncated hemicylinder at X=10 cm and
   Y=15 cm with respect to the origin of the unit, and rotate it (in
   KENO-VI input) so it is in the YZ plane at X=10 and at a 45° angle
   with the Y plane.

   KENO V.a (no rotation possible, no label):

   **ZHEMICYL+X** 1 1 5.0 7.0 2.0 **CHORD** 3.0 **ORIGIN** 10.0 15.0

   KENO-VI (no material; this is to be specified with **MEDIA** card):

   **CYLINDER** 10 5.0 7.0 2.0 **CHORD** **+X**\ = −3.0 **ORIGIN**
   **X**\ =10.0 **Y**\ =15.0 **ROTATE** **A2**\ = −45

.. _8-1-2-4-1-2:

COM=
....

The keyword **COM**\ = signals that a comment is to be read. The
optional comment can be placed anywhere within a unit definition. Its
syntax is:

**COM** = *delim comment delim*

*delim*
  is the delimiter, which may be any one of “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !

*comment*
  is the comment string, up to 132 characters long.

Example of comment within a **UNIT**:

**COM**\ =“This is a fuel pin”

.. _8-1-4-2-1-3:

HOLE
....

This entry is used to position a **UNIT** within a surrounding **UNIT**
relative to the origin of the surrounding **UNIT**. **HOLE**\ s may
share surfaces with but may not intersect other **HOLE**\ s, the
**BOUNDARY** of the **UNIT** which contains the **HOLE**, or an
**ARRAY** boundary. In KENO-VI, the **BOUNDARY** record of a **UNIT**
placed in a **HOLE** may contain more than one geometry label, but all
labels must be positive, indicating inside the respective geometry
bodies. The syntax for **HOLE** is:

KENO V.a:
**HOLE** *u x y z*

KENO-VI:
**HOLE** *u* [*a*\ :sub:`1` … [*a*\ :sub:`M` ]…]

*u*
  is the unit previously defined that is to be placed within the
  **HOLE**.

*x y z*
  is the position of the **HOLE** in the KENO V.a host **UNIT**.

*a\ 1 … a\ M*
  are optional KENO-VI *ATTRIBUTES* for the **HOLE**. The
  *ATTRIBUTES* can be **ORIGIN** or **ROTATE** and follow the same syntax
  previously defined for KENO-VI **shape** *ATTRIBUTES*. These
  *ATTRIBUTES* allow for the translation and/or rotation of the **HOLE**
  within the host region.

Examples of **HOLE** use:

Place **UNIT** 2 in the surrounding **UNIT** such that the **ORIGIN** of
**UNIT** 2 is at **X**\ =3, **Y**\ =3.5, **Z**\ =4 relative to the
origin of the surrounding **UNIT**.

KENO V.a:
**HOLE** 2 3 3.5 4

KENO-VI:
**HOLE** 2 **ORIGIN** **X**\ =3.0 **Y**\ =3.5 **Z**\ =4.0

.. _8-1-2-4-1-4:

ARRAY
.....

When used within a **UNIT** description, this entry provides an
**ARRAY** placement description. In KENO V.a, it always starts a new
**UNIT** and generates a rectangular parallelepiped that fits the outer
boundaries of the specified **ARRAY**. The specified **ARRAY** is
positioned in the **UNIT** according to the most negative point in the
**ARRAY** with respect to the coordinate system of the surrounding
**UNIT**. Thus, the location of the minimum x, minimum y, and minimum z
point in the array is specified in the coordinate system of the **UNIT**
into which the **ARRAY** is being placed.

In KENO-VI, the **ARRAY** keyword is used to position an **ARRAY**
within a region in a surrounding **UNIT** relative to the origin of the
surrounding **UNIT**. When the subordinate keyword **PLACE** is entered,
it is followed by six numbers that precisely locate the **ARRAY** within
the surrounding **UNIT** as shown in the example below. The first three
numbers consist of the element in the **ARRAY** of the **UNIT** selected
to position the **ARRAY**. The next three numbers consist of the
position of the origin of the selected **UNIT** in the surrounding
**UNIT**. Higher level **ARRAY** boundaries may intersect lower level
**ARRAY** boundaries as long as they do not intersect **HOLE**\ s in the
**UNIT**\ s contained in the **ARRAY** or in **UNIT**\ s contained in
lower level **ARRAY**\ s.

The syntax for the **ARRAY** card is as follows:

KENO V.a:
**ARRAY** *array_id* *x y z*

KENO-VI:
**ARRAY** *array_id* *l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N` [**PLACE** *N*\ :sub:`x` *N*\ :sub:`y` *N*\ :sub:`z` *x y
z*]

*array_id*
  is the label that identifies the array to be placed.

*l\ 1* … *l\ N*
  is the *REGION DEFINITION VECTOR*. These are previously
  defined **shape** labels, and together they define the region in which
  the array *array_id* is to be placed. This is used only in KENO-VI.

*N\ x N\ y N\ z*
  are three integers that define the element in the
  **ARRAY** of the **UNIT** selected to position the **ARRAY**. This is
  used only in KENO-VI.

*x y z*
  specify the position of the **ARRAY** in the **UNIT**.

  In KENO V.a, the x, y, and z values are the point where the most
  negative x, y, and z point of the **ARRAY** is to be located in the
  **UNIT**\ ’s coordinates.

  In KENO-VI, the x, y, and z values are the point where the origin of the
  **UNIT** specified by *N\ x*, *N\ y*, and *N\ z* is to be located in the
  **shape** specified by the *REGION DEFINITION VECTOR*.

Example of **ARRAY** use:

In KENO V.a, position the most negative point of **ARRAY** 6 at X = 2.0,
Y = 3.0, Z = 4.0 relative to the origin of the containing **UNIT**.

**ARRAY** 6 2.0 3.0 4.0

In KENO-VI, position instead the origin of **UNIT** (1,2,3) of **ARRAY**
6 at X = 2.0, Y = 3.0, Z = 4.0 and specify the **ARRAY** boundary to be
the region that is inside the geometry **shape**\ s labeled 10 and 20
and outside the geometry **shape** labeled 30 used to describe the
surrounding **UNIT**.

**ARRAY** 6 10 20 −30 **PLACE** 1 2 3 2.0 3.0 4.0

REPLICATE and REFLECTOR
.......................


These keywords specific to KENO V.a are used to generate additional
geometry regions having the **shape** of the previous region. The
geometry keyword **REFLECTOR** is a synonym for **REPLICATE**. The
desired weighting functions can be applied to those regions by
specifying biasing data as described in :ref:`8-1-2-7`. The total
thickness generated for each surface is the thickness per region for
that surface times the number of regions to be generated, *nreg*.

The replicate specification is frequently used to generate weighting
regions external to an **ARRAY** placement description. Thus an
**ARRAY** placement description followed by a **REPLICATE** description
would generate regions of a cuboidal shape. A cylindrical reflector
could be generated by following the **ARRAY** placement description with
a **CYLINDER** and then a **REPLICATE**. A **HOLE** cannot immediately
follow a **REPLICATE**.

Extra regions using default weights can be generated by specifying the
first importance region, *imp*, to be one that was not defined in the
*BIASING INFORMATION* provided in a **READ BIAS** block. This capability
can be used to generate extra regions for collecting information such as
fluxes, leakage, etc.

Multiple replicate descriptions can be used in any problem. This
capability can be used to model different reflector materials of
different thicknesses on different faces.

The number of appropriate region dimensions needed for specifying
**REPLICATE** is determined by the preceding region. For example, if the
previous region were a **SPHERE**, one entry (i.e., *t*\ :sub:`1`) would be
required. If the previous region were a **CYLINDER**, the first entry,
*t*\ :sub:`1`, would be the thickness/region in the radial direction, the
second entry, *t*\ :sub:`2`, would the thickness/region in the positive length
direction, the third entry, *t*\ :sub:`3`, would be the thickness/region in the
negative length direction, etc. The **REPLICATE** specification
requirements for a **CUBE** are the same as for a **CUBOID**.

Syntax:

**REPLICATE|REFLECTOR** *m* *b* *t*\ :sub:`1` … *t*\ :sub:`N` *nreg*

*m*
  is the number of the material (non-negative integer) that fills the
  particular REPLICATE/REFLECTOR region in the **UNIT** description. A
  material of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present
  in the volume defined by the **shape**).

*b*
  is the bias identification number (positive integer) assigned to the
  particular region defined by the **shape** in the KENO V.a **UNIT**
  description. If the specified bias ID is defined in a **READ BIAS**
  block, the bias ID number will be incremented automatically, increasing
  one for each additional region up to *nreg*.

*t*\ :sub:`1` … *t*\ :sub:`N`
  represent the thickness (floating point number) per region
  for each of the *N* surfaces that define the particular **shape**. If
  the specified bias ID is one that is defined in the READ BIAS block, the
  region thicknesses should be consistent with the thicknesses used to
  generate the bias data being used. See :ref:`9-1-2-7`.

*nreg*
  is the number of regions (integer) to be generated.

Example:

Create five regions of material 4, each being 3 cm thick, outside a
cuboid region (a cuboid has six dimensions). The inner-most of the five
generated regions has a *bias id* of 2. The following four regions have
*bias id* of 3, 4, 5, and 6.

MEDIA
.....

This card is used in the KENO-VI input file to define the location of a
mixture relative to the geometric **shape**\ s in the **UNIT**.
:numref:`fig8-1-11` shows the input for a set of three intersecting
**SPHERE**\ s in a **CUBOID**. The total volume data for a region in the
problem may be entered as the last entry on the **MEDIA** card by using
the keyword “\ **VOL**\ =” keyword immediately followed by the volume in
cm\ :sup:`3`. The volume entered is the volume of the region in the unit
multiplied by the number of times the unit occurs in the problem minus
any volume excluded from the problem by **ARRAY** boundaries and
**HOLE**\ s. The volumes for any or all regions may be entered. If the
volume is entered here, this value will be used even if volumes are also
entered as a file or calculated (See :ref:`8-1-2-13`). Volumes not
entered will be determined by the input specified in the VOLUME DATA
block. If no volume is supplied, the KENO-VI default volume of -1 will
be used. This only affects volume-averaged quantities, i.e., not
*k*\ :sub:`eff`.

Syntax:

**MEDIA** *m* *b* *l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N` [**VOL**\ =\ *v*]

*m*
  is the material (positive integer or zero for vacuum) that fills the
  region defined by **MEDIA**.

*b*
  is the *bias id* for the material sector being defined.

*l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N`
  is the region definition vector (*N* integers). These
  are *N* previously defined **shape** labels that together define the
  material sector.

**VOL**\ =
  is an optional sub-keyword used to input the material sector
  volume.

*v*
  is the volume in cm\ :sup:`3` of the material sector defined by the
  **MEDIA** card.

BOUNDARY
........

This card is used in KENO-VI to define the outer boundary of the
**UNIT**. In KENO V.a, the outer boundary of the **UNIT** is implicitly
defined by the last **shape** in the **UNIT**. Each **UNIT** must have
one and only one **BOUNDARY** card.

Syntax:

**BOUNDARY** *l\ 1* … *l\ N*

*l*\ :sub:`1` … *l*\ :sub:`N`
  is the **UNIT** *BOUNDARY DEFINITION VECTOR* (*N*
  integers). These are *N* previously defined **shape** labels that
  together define the outer boundary of the **UNIT**. All entries must be
  positive for the **UNIT** being defined to be used subsequently as a
  **HOLE**.

ARRAY Data
~~~~~~~~~~

The array definition data block is used to define the size of an
**ARRAY** and to position **UNIT**\ s (defined in the geometry data) in
a 3-D lattice that represents the **ARRAY** being described. As many
arrays as are necessary can be described in a problem, subject to
computer storage limitations. In KENO V.a, only one **ARRAY** may be
placed directly in a **UNIT**, but as many **ARRAY**\ s as are needed
may be placed in the **UNIT** by using **HOLE**\ s. In KENO-VI,
any number of arrays can be placed in any **UNIT** either directly or
indirectly using **HOLE**\ s. There is no default global array. If a
global array is desired it must be explicitly defined.

The **ARRAY** definition data is entered as:

READ ARRAY ARRAY_ DATA END ARRAY

The *ARRAY\_ DATA* consists of *ARRAY_PARAMETERS* and
*UNIT_ORIENTATION_DESCRIPTION*.

.. _8-1-2-5-1:

ARRAY Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ARRAY parameters that can be used in the definition of an ARRAY are:

**ARA**\ =

**GBL**\ =

**NUX**\ =, **NUY**\ =, **NUZ**\ =

**PRT**\ =

**COM**\ =

**TYP**\ = (KENO-VI only)

ARA=
....

The **ARA**\ = parameter defines a reference number for an **ARRAY**. It
has no default in KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, if is missing, the default is 1.

Syntax:

**ARA**\ =\ *a*

*a*
  is the reference number for the **ARRAY**. It has no default in
  KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, if is missing, the default is 1.

GBL=
....

This is used to input the number of the global array.

Syntax:

**GBL**\ =\ *g*

*g*
  is the reference number for the global **ARRAY**. In KENO V.a it
  must not be entered more than once. The default is the largest value for
  *a*, the reference number for the **ARRAY**. In KENO-VI it is no default
  value and if entered more than once, the last value is used.

PRT=
....

This entry is used to enable printing the **ARRAY** of **UNIT** numbers.

Syntax:

**PRT**\ =\ *print*

*print*
  is a logical constant which defaults to YES, indicating that the
  **ARRAY** of **UNIT** numbers is printed. If the value is NO, then a
  summary table is printed instead containing the number of times each
  unit is used in each array.

.. _8-1-2-5-1-4:

NUX=, NUY=, NUZ=
................


These entries are used to input the number of units in the X, Y, and Z
directions, respectively.

Syntax:

**NUX**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`x` **NUY**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`y` **NUZ**\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`z`

*n*\ :sub:`x` *n*\ :sub:`y` *n*\ :sub:`z`
  are the number of units in the X, Y, and Z directions,
  respectively. There is no default in KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, each of them
  defaults to 1.

TYPE=
.....

This entry is used to specify the type of **ARRAY** and is specific to
KENO-VI, where more than one type of arrays can be used. It cannot be
used in KENO V.a.

Syntax:

**TYP**\ =\ *atyp*

*atyp*
  type of array (**cuboidal** or **square**, **hexagonal** or
  **triangular**, **rhexagonal**, **shexagonal**, **dodecahedral**),
  default = **cuboidal**

.. _8-1-2-5-1-6:

COM=
....

This keyword is used to enter a comment.

Syntax:

**COM**\ =\ *delim comment delim*

*delim*
  is a delimiter. Acceptable delimiters are “, ‘, \* , ^ , or !.

*comment*
  is the comment string. Maximum *comment* length is
  132 characters.

.. _8-1-2-5-2:

ARRAY orientation data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two methods to enter the **UNIT** numbers constituting an
**ARRAY**: **LOOP** and **FILL**.

LOOP Construct
..............

The **LOOP** construct resembles a FORTRAN DO-loop construct.
The arrangement of **UNIT**\ s may be considered as consisting of a 3-D
matrix of **UNIT** numbers, with the **UNIT** position increasing in the
positive X, Y, and Z directions, respectively.

Syntax:

**LOOP** *u* *ix*\ :sub:`1` *ix*\ :sub:`2` incx *iy*\ :sub:`1` *iy*\ :sub:`2` incy *iz*\ :sub:`1` *iz*\ :sub:`2` *incz* **END
LOOP**

*u*
  is the **UNIT** identification number (a positive integer).

*ix*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the X direction; *ix*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`x` of :ref:`8-1-2-5-1-4`.

*ix*\ :sub:`2` is the ending position in the X direction; *ix*\ :sub:`2` must be at
least 1 and less than or equal to *n\ x*.

*incx*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive X direction; *incx* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub:`x`.

*iy*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the Y direction; *iy*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`y`.

*iy*\ :sub:`2`
  is the ending position in the Y direction; *iy*\ :sub:`2` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`y`.

*incy*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive Y direction; *incy* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub:`y`.

*iz*\ :sub:`1`
  is the starting position in the Z direction; *iz*\ :sub:`1` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

*iz*\ :sub:`2`
  is the ending position in the Z direction;, *iz*\ :sub:`2` must be at
  least 1 and less than or equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

*incz*
  is the number of **UNIT**\ s by which increments are made in the
  positive Z direction; *incz* must be greater than zero and less than or
  equal to *n*\ :sub:`z`.

The syntax for ending the **LOOP** construct is:

**END LOOP**

The sequence *u* through *incz* is repeated until the entire **ARRAY**
is described. If any portion of an **ARRAY** is defined in a conflicting
manner, the last entry to define that portion will determine the
**ARRAY**\ ’s configuration. To use this feature, fill the entire
**ARRAY** with the most relevant **UNIT** number and superimpose the
other **UNIT** numbers in their proper places. An example showing the
use of the **LOOP** option is given below. This 5 × 4 × 3 **ARRAY** of
**UNIT**\ s is a matrix of **UNIT**\ s that has 5 \ **UNIT**\ s stacked
in the X direction, 4 \ **UNIT**\ s in the Y direction, and
3 \ **UNIT**\ s in the Z direction. X increases from left to right, and
Y increases from bottom to top. Each Z layer is shown separately.

.. highlight:: scale

Given:

::

		1 2 1 2 1	  2 1 2 1 2	  1 1 1 1 1
		1 1 1 1 1	  2 2 2 2 2	  1 3 3 3 1
		1 1 1 1 1	  2 2 2 2 2	  1 3 3 3 1
		1 2 1 2 1	  2 1 2 1 2	  1 1 1 1 1
		Z Layer 1	  Z Layer 2	  Z Layer 3

The data for this array could be entered using the following entries.

(1)  1  1 5 1  1 4 1  1 3 1
This fills the entire array with 1s.

(2)  2  2 5 2  1 4 3  1 1 1
This loads the four 2s in the first Z layer.

(3)  2  1 5 1  2 3 1  2 2 1
This loads the second and third rows of 2s in the second Z layer.

(4)  2  1 5 2  1 4 3  2 2 1
This loads the desired 2s in the first and fourth rows of the second Z layer.

(5)  3  2 4 1  2 3 1  3 3 1
This loads the 3s in the third Z layer and completes the array data input.

The second layer could have been defined by substituting the following data for entries (3) and (4):

(3)  2  1 5 1  1 4 1  2 2 1
This completely fills the second layer with 2s.

(4)  1  2 4 2  1 4 3  2 2 1
This loads the four 1s in the second layer.

When using the **LOOP** option, there is no single correct method of
entering the data. If a **UNIT** is improperly positioned in the
**ARRAY** or if some positions in the **ARRAY** are left undefined, it
is often easier to add data to correctly define the **ARRAY** than to
try to correct the existing data.

FILL Construct
..............

The **FILL** construct enters data by stringing in **UNIT** numbers
starting at X=1, Y=1, Z=1, and varying X, then Y, and then Z to fill the
**ARRAY**. *n*\ :sub:`x` x *n*\ :sub:`y` x *n*\ :sub:`z` entries are required. FIDO-like
input options specified in :numref:`tab8-1-17` are also available for filling
the **ARRAY**.

Syntax:

**FILL** *u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`N` {**END FILL}**\ \|\ **T**

*u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`N` are the *N*\ =\ *n*\ :sub:`x` x *n*\ :sub:`y` x *n*\ :sub:`z` **UNIT** numbers
that make up the **ARRAY**

The syntax for ending the **FILL** construct is

**END FILL**

An alternative to end the **UNIT** data in **FILL** is by entering the
letter **T**.

.. note:: When entering data using the options in this table, the *count
   field* and *option field* must be adjacent with no imbedded blanks.
   The operand field may be separated from the option field by one or
   more blanks.

Example: Consider a 3 × 3 × 1 **ARRAY** filled with 8 **UNIT** 1s and a
**UNIT** 2, as shown below.

::


  1	1	1
  1	2	1
  1	1	1

The input data to describe this **ARRAY** could be entered as follows:

Option (1) 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 **T**
  This fills the array one position at a time,
  starting at the lower left corner. The \ **T** terminates the data.

\

or

\

Option (2) F1 A5 2 **END FILL**
  The F1 fills the entire array with 1s, the A5
  locates the fifth position in the array, and the 2 loads a 2 in that
  position. The **END FILL** terminates the data.

Albedo data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Albedo boundary conditions are entered by assigning an albedo condition
to each face of the outermost boundary. The **default value for each
face is vacuum**. The default values are overridden only on faces for
which other albedo names are specified. Albedo boundary conditions are
applied **only** to **the outermost region of a problem.** In KENO V.a
this geometry region must be a rectangular parallelepiped. The outer
boundary can be any **shape** (or combination of **shape**\ s) in
KENO-VI. Material-specific albedos (e.g., H2O and CONC) may not be used
in continuous energy calculations.

KENO-VI users need to be aware that when a neutron reaches a surface
with a vacuum albedo, that neutron is lost. If a model contains features
that are reentrant, that is a neutron could exit the model and reenter
the model on the other side of an unmodeled region, all neutrons passing
through the problem boundary are lost when they reach the unmodeled
region. Neutrons are not “transported” across unmodeled areas between
reentrant surfaces. It is not possible to create a KENO V.a model with
reentrant problem outer boundary surfaces.

The syntax for entering the albedo boundary conditions is:

**READ BOUNDS** **fc**\ :sub:`1`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`1` [**fc**\ :sub:`2`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`2`\ …
[**fc**\ :sub:`N`\ =\ *a*\ :sub:`N` ]…] **END BOUNDS**

**fc**\ :sub:`1` … **fc**\ :sub:`N` are **N** face codes as defined in :numref:`tab8-1-18`.

*a*\ :sub:`1` … *a*\ :sub:`N` are the albedo types as defined in :numref:`tab8-1-19`

:numref:`tab8-1-19` lists some material-specific albedo sets. Care must be
exercised when using material-specific albedo types. These data sets
were generated using a real problem, and they implicitly reflect the
neutron energy spectrum, materials, and geometry from that model. Where
neutron energy spectra, materials, and geometry vary from that model,
the material-specific albedos may give significantly incorrect results.
This may be checked by comparing results from a sample of calculations
performed with both explicitly modeled reflectors and material-specific
albedos. In general, use of material-specific albedos is not
recommended.

The **BODY** and **SURFACE** keywords are unique to KENO-VI. The face
code **BODY**\ = refers to the body label in global unit input. For
example, assume the **GLOBAL UNIT** boundary record in a KENO-VI input
consisted of the following: **BOUNDARY** 10 −30 20. In this case
**BODY**\ =10 would refer to the geometry record labeled 10,
**BODY**\ =20 would refer to the geometry record labeled 20, and
**BODY**\ =30 would refer to the geometry record labeled 30. All surface
numbers following the **BODY** keyword apply to that body. The default
value of **BODY** is the first geometry label listed in the **GLOBAL
UNIT** boundary record.

All the face codes, listed in the first part of :numref:`tab8-1-18`, except
**BODY**\ = and **SURFACE**\ (ii)= were intended to apply only to
cuboids (KENO V.a). However, when used with non-cuboidal surfaces
(KENO-VI) they will fill in the first six surface positions of a body in
the following order, +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z. The **ALL** face code will
apply the listed boundary conditions to all surfaces of the body
currently being considered.

Albedo boundary conditions may be entered on each **GLOBAL UNIT**
boundary surface multiple times. The boundary condition that applies to
the surface is the last one entered. If no boundary data are entered or
if no albedo boundary condition is applied to a **GLOBAL UNIT** boundary
surface, then the boundary surface is assumed to have a void or vacuum
boundary condition. Any **CHORD**\ ed surfaces that are **GLOBAL UNIT**
boundaries will use the default (void) boundary condition, and it cannot
be changed. This restriction may need to be considered when building the
geometry of the **GLOBAL UNIT**.

Example:
  Use a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face
  of a problem with a cuboidal boundary and use mirror image reflection on
  the +X and −X faces of the cuboid to represent an infinite linear array
  on a 2 ft. thick concrete pad.

  **READ BOUNDS** **−ZB**\ =CON24 **XFC**\ =MIRROR **END BOUNDS**

Example:
  Use a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face
  of a problem with a hexagonal boundary, and use mirror image reflection
  on all side faces of the hexprism to represent an infinite planar array
  on a 2 ft. thick concrete pad.

  **READ BOUNDS**

  **SURFACE**\ (1)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (2)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (3)=MIRROR

  **SURFACE**\ (4)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (5)=MIRROR **SURFACE**\ (6)=MIRROR

  **SURFACE**\ (7)=VACUUM **SURFACE**\ (8)=CONC24

  **END BOUNDS**

Example:
  The outer boundary of the global unit consists of a cuboid
  (body label 10) and a sphere (body label 20). The sphere is large enough
  to cut the corners of the cuboid leaving most of the cuboid intact. Use
  a 24 in. concrete albedo boundary condition on the −Z face of the cuboid
  to represent a 2 ft. thick concrete pad. Use the DP0H2O on the other
  surfaces to represent an infinite water reflector.

  **READ BOUNDS**

  **BODY**\ =10 **ALL**\ =DP0H2O **−ZB**\ =CON24

  **BODY**\ =20 **SURFACE**\ (1)=DP0H2O

  **END BOUNDS**

.. WARNING:: The user should thoroughly understand material-specific
  albedos (e.g., DP0H2O, CON24, etc.) before attempting to use these
  reflectors. Missapplication of these problem-specific albedo data can
  cause the code to produce incorrect results without obvious symptoms.**

Biasing or weighting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The biasing data block is used (in only multigroup mode) to define the
weight that is given to a neutron surviving Russian roulette. The
average weight of a neutron that survives Russian roulette, *wtavg*, is
defaulted to *dwtav* (**WTA**\ = in the parameter data [see :ref:`8-1-2-3`])
for all *BIAS IDs* and can be overridden by entering biasing
information.

The *biasing_information* is used to relate a *BIAS ID* to the desired
energy-dependent values of *wtavg*. This concept is similar to the way
the *MIXTURE ID, mat*, is related to the macroscopic cross section data.

The weighting functions used in KENO  are energy-dependent values of
*wtavg* that are applicable over a given thickness interval of a
material. For example, the weighting function for water is composed of
sets of energy-dependent values of *wtavg* for 11 intervals, each
interval being 3 cm thick. The first set of *wtavg’s* is for the 0–3 cm
interval of water, the second set of *wtavg’s* is for the 3–6 cm
interval of water, etc. The eleventh set of *wtavg’s* is for the 30–33
cm interval of water.

To input biasing information, a *BIAS ID* must be assigned to correspond
to a set of *wtavg*. Biasing data can specify a *MATERIAL ID* from the
existing KENO V.a weighting library or from the *AUXILIARY DATA* input.
The materials available from the KENO  weighting library are listed in
:numref:`tab8-1-20`.

The *biasing_information* is entered in one of the following two forms.
The first set is said to input the *CORRELATION DATA*, while the second
form is said to input the *AUXILIARY DATA*.

**READ BIAS ID**\ =\ *m ib ie* **END BIAS**

or

**READ BIAS WT**\ [**S**]=\ *wttitl id s* *t*\ :sub:`1` *i*\ :sub:`1` *g*\ :sub:`1` *w*\ :sub:`1,1` …
*w*\ :sub:`1,i1xg1` … *t*\ :sub:`s` *i*\ :sub:`s` *g*\ :sub:`s` *w*\ :sub:`s,1` … *w*\ :sub:`s,isxgs`   **END BIAS**

**ID=** specifies that *CORRELATION DATA* will be entered next.

**WT=** or **WTS=** specifies that *AUXILIARY DATA* will be entered
next.

*m*
  is the identification (material ID) for the material whose weighting
  function is to be used. A material ID can be chosen from the existing
  KENO weighting library (:numref:`tab8-1-20`) or from the *auxiliary data* input
  using the second form of the **BIAS** block as described later. If a
  material ID appears in both the KENO weighting library and the
  *auxiliary data*, the *weights* from the *auxiliary data* will be used.

*ib*
  is the bias ID of the weighting function for the first interval of
  material *m*. The geometry record having the bias ID equal to *ib* will
  use the group-dependent *weights* from the first interval of material
  *m*.

*ie*
  is the bias ID of the group-dependent *weights* from the (*ie* −
  *ib* + 1)\ *th* interval of material *m*.

*wttitl*
  is an arbitrary title name (12 characters maximum), such as
  CONCRETE, WATER, SPECIALH2O, etc., to identify the material for which
  the user is entering data. Embedded blanks are not allowed.

*id*
  is an identification number (material ID). The value is arbitrary.
  However, if the data are to be utilized in the problem, this ID must
  also be used at least once in the first form of the **BIAS** block.

*s*
  is the number of sets of group structures for which *weights* will
  be read for this ID.

*t*\ :sub:`1`\ … *t*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* thicknesses of each increment for which *weights*
  will be read for this ID.

*i*\ :sub:`1`\ … *i*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* numbers of increments for which *weights* will be
  read for this ID.

*g*\ :sub:`1`\ … *g*\ :sub:`s`
  are *s* numbers of energy groups for which *weights* will
  be read.

*w*\ :sub:`1,i1xg1`\ … *w*\ :sub:`s,isxgs`
  are *s* sets of *weights*, each set containing
  a number of *weights* equal to the product of number of increments times
  the number of groups for that set. The group index varies the fastest.

.. Warning:: The user should thoroughly understand weighted tracking
  before attempting to generate and use auxiliary data for biasing. Incorrect
  weighting can cause the code to produce incorrect results without obvious symptoms.

.. caution:: 1. Each set of *AUXILIARY* or *CORRELATION* data must be completely
  described in conjunction with its keyword. Complete sets of these data
  can be interspersed in an arbitrary order but data within each set must
  be entered in the specified order.

  2. *AUXILIARY DATA*: If the same *m* is specified in more than one set
  of data, the last set having the group structure used in the problem is
  the set that will be utilized. When *AUXILIARY DATA* are entered,
  *CORRELATION DATA* must also be entered in order to use the *AUXILIARY
  DATA*.

  3. *CORRELATION DATA*: If biasing data define the same bias ID (from the
  geometry data) more than once, the value that is entered last supersedes
  previous entries. *Be well aware that multiple definitions for the same
  bias ID can cause erroneous answers due to overbiasing.*

  4. Bias data may not be used in continuous energy mode.

.. centered:: Examples

1. Use the first form of the **BIAS** block to utilize the water biasing
   factors in bias IDs 2 through 11. From :numref:`tab8-1-20`, water has
   material ID m=500 and has bias parameters for 10 intervals that are
   each 3 cm thick.

**READ BIAS ID**\ =500 2 11 **END BIAS**

2. Use the second form of the **BIAS** block to specify biasing factors
   for SPECIALWATER to be used in bias IDs 6 and 7. The SPECIALWATER
   biasing factors have a value of 0.69 for BIAS ID 6 and 0.86 for bias
   ID 7 in each energy group. Sixteen-group cross sections are being
   used. Each weighting region is 3.048 cm thick. The material ID is
   arbitrarily chosen to be 510. Note that the first form of the
   **BIAS** block must be entered to allow the second form of the
   **BIAS** block to be used for BIAS IDs 6 and 7.

**READ BIAS WT**\ =SPECIALWATER 510 1 3.048 2 16 16*0.69 16*0.86
**ID**\ =510 6 7 **END BIAS**

3. An example of multiple definitions for the same bias ID follows:

**READ BIAS ID**\ =400 2 7 **ID**\ =500 5 7 **END BIAS** .

The data for paraffin (**ID**\ =400) will be used for bias IDs 2, 3, and
4, and the data for water (**ID**\ =500) will be used for bias IDs 5, 6,
and 7. The paraffin data for bias IDs 5, 6, and 7 have been overwritten
by water data.

Multiple definitions for the same bias ID are not necessarily incorrect,
but the user should be cautious about using multiple definitions and
should ensure that the desired biasing or weighting functions are used
in the desired geometry regions.

4. An example of how the *bias ID* relates to the energy-dependent
   values of *weights* is given below.

Assume that a paraffin reflector is to be used, and it is desirable to
use the weighting function from the KENO weighting library to minimize
the running time for the problem. Also assume that these weighting
functions are to be used in the volumes defined in the geometry records
having the *bias ID* (defined on a **shape** or **MEDIA** card for KENO
V.a and KENO-VI, respectively) equal to 6, 7, 8, and 9. *Correlation
data* are then entered and *auxiliary data* will not be entered.

The biasing data would be:

**READ BIAS ID**\ =400 6 9 **END BIAS**.

The results of these data are

(1) the group-dependent *weights* for the 0–3 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 6.

(2) the group-dependent *weights* for the 3–6 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 7.

(3) the group-dependent *weights* for the 6–9 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 8.

(4) the group-dependent *weights* for the 9–12 cm interval of paraffin
will be used in the volume defined by the geometry region having *bias
ID*\ = 9.

Start data
~~~~~~~~~~

Special start options are available for controlling the initial neutron
distribution. The default starting distribution for an array is flat
over the overall array dimensions, in fissile material only. The default
starting distribution for a single unit is flat over the system, in
fissile material only. See :numref:`tab8-1-21` for the starting distributions
available in KENO. The syntax for the **START** block is:

Extra 1-D XSECS IDs data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extra 1-D cross section IDs are not required. They are allowed as input
in order to simplify future modifications to calculate reaction rates,
etc., as well as for compatibility with other SCALE codes. The syntax
for the extra 1-D cross section data block is:

**READ X1DS** **NEUTRON** *i\ 1 …i\ x1d* **END X1DS**

**NEUTRON**
  is a keyword to indicate that the following ID identifies a
  neutron interaction.

*i*\ :sub:`1` … *i*\ :sub:`x1d`
  **X1D** 1-D identification numbers or keyword identifiers
  for the 1-D cross section to be used. These cross sections must be
  available on the mixture cross section library. **X1D** entries are
  expected to be read (see integer PARAMETER data).

.. _8-1-2-10:

Mixing table data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A cross section mixing table must be entered if KENO is being run stand
alone and a Monte Carlo cross section format library is not being used
in the multigroup mode, or KENO is being run stand alone in the
continuous energy mode. If the parameter **LIB**\ = (Sect. 8.1.2.3) is
entered, then mixing table data must be entered. A cross section mixing
table is entered using the following syntax:

**READ MIXT** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END MIXT**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters that might or might not be keyworded.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **MIXT** block are
described below.

**SCT =** *nsct*
  is used to input the number of scattering angles and
  only applies in multigroup mode. *nsct* is the number of discrete
  scattering angles, default = 1. The number of scattering angles
  specifies the number of discrete scattering angles to be used for the
  cross sections. If SCT is not set (i.e., SCT= −1), then the number of
  scattering angles is determined from the cross section library
  specified. The number of scattering angles defaults to (ncoef+1)/2,
  where ncoef is the largest Legendre polynomial order used in the
  problem. It needs to be entered only once for a problem. If more than
  one value is entered, the last one is used for the problem. For
  assistance in determining the number of discrete scattering angles for
  the cross sections, see :ref:`8-1-3-4-3`.

**EPS =** *pbxs*
  is used to enter the cross section message cutoff
  value, and it only applies in multigroup mode. *pbxs* is the value of
  the P\ :sub:`0` cross section for each transfer, above which generated
  warning messages will be printed, default = 3 × 10\ :sup:`−5`. The
  primary purpose of entering this cutoff value is to suppress printing
  these messages when they are generated during cross section processing.
  For assistance in determining a value for EPS, see :ref:`8-1-3-4-4`.

**MIX =** *mix*
  is used to input the identification number of the
  mixture being described. *mix* defines the mixture being described.

**NCM** = *ncmx*
  is used to input the nuclide mixture IDs to be used for
  this mixture. *ncmx* defines the nuclide mixture ID. When
  **MIX**\ =\ *mix* is read, *ncmx* is defaulted to *mix* also. Then, as
  long as all the nuclides that need to be mixed into *mix* already have
  *mix* specified as their nuclide mixture (frequently the case when using
  SCALE), the user does not need to specify **NCM**. The most usual case
  where **NCM** must be specified is when the mixtures were specified as a
  different mixture number when they were created in SCALE as compared to
  the mixture number used for them in KENO. Cell homogenized mixtures also
  need **NCM** specified.

**TMP**\ \|\ **TEM** = *temperature*
  is used to input the desired
  temperature of the CE cross section data.

*nucl*
  is the nuclide ID number from the AMPX working format cross
  section library.

**XS**\ =\ *fname*
  is used to input the optional continuous energy cross
  section filename to override the default cross sections. *fname* is the
  name of the file.

*dens*
  is the number density (atoms/b-cm) associated with nuclide ID
  number *nucl*.

The sequence “\ *nucl* **NCM**\ =\ *ncmx* [**XS**\ =\ *fname*] *dens*\ ”
may be repeated until the mixture defined by **MIX**\ =\ *mix* has been
completely described.

The sequence “\ **MIX =** *mix* **NCM** = *ncmx* **TMP**\ \|\ **TEM** =
*temperature nucl* **NCM**\ =\ *ncmx* [**XS**\ =\ *fname*] *dens*\ ” may
be repeated until all the mixtures have been described.

.. note:: If a given nuclide ID is entered more than once in the same
   mixture, then the number densities for that nuclide are summed.

   If a mixture number is used as a nuclide ID, then it is treated as a
   nuclide and the number density associated with it is used as a
   density modifier. (If the density is entered as 1, then the mixture
   is mixed in at full density. If it is entered as 0.5, the mixture is
   mixed in at one half of its full density.) A Monte Carlo formatted
   cross section library is generated on the unit defined by the
   parameter **XSC=**. If this data set is saved, subsequent cases can
   utilize these mixtures without remixing.

   The entry **XS**\ =\ *fname* is optional. If a nuclide is entered
   more than once in a mixture and this entry is specified, then they
   must be the same (i.e., cannot use more than one continuous energy
   cross section sets for a nuclide in a given mixture). Different
   mixtures may have the same nuclide with different continuous energy
   cross section sets.

.. _8-1-2-11:

Plot data
~~~~~~~~~

Plots of slices specified through the geometry can be generated and
displayed (1) as character plots using alphanumeric characters to
represent mixture numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers or (2) as
color plots which generate a PNG file using colors to represent mixture
numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers. Color plots require an
independent program to display the PNG file to a PC or workstation
monitor or to convert the file to be displayed using a plotting device.
The keyword **SCR=** is used to control the plot display method.
**SCR**\ =YES, the default value, uses the color plot display method.
**SCR**\ =NO uses the character plot display method. The value of
**SCR** determines the plot display method for all the plots specified
in a problem. If **SCR**\ = is entered more than once, the last entry
determines the plot display method. In other words, all plots generated
by a problem will be either character plots or color plots.

The plot data can include the data for any or all types of plots. A plot
by mixture number is the default. The kind of plot is defined by the
parameter **PIC=**. Character plots are printed after the volumes are
printed and before the final preparations for tracking are completed.
Plot data are not required for a problem, but theyb can be used to
verify the problem description. The actual plotting of the picture can
be suppressed by entering **PLT= NO** in the parameter data or plot
data. This allows plot data to be kept in the problem input for
reference purposes without actually plotting the picture(s). Entering a
value for **PLT** in the plot data will override any value entered in
the parameter data. However, if a problem is restarted, the value of
**PLT** from the parameter data is used. The upper left and lower right
coordinates of the plot must be specified relative to the origin of the
problem. See :ref:`8-1-3-9` for a discussion of plot origins and plot
data.

Enter the plot data using the following syntax:

**READ PLOT** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END PLOT**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters entered using keywords followed by the
  appropriate data. The plot title and the plot character string must be
  contained within delimiters. Enter as many picture parameters as
  necessary to describe the plot. Multiple sets of plot data can be
  entered. The parameter input for each plot is terminated by a labeled or
  unlabeled **END**. The labeled **END** cannot use the word **PLOT** as
  the first four characters of the label. For example, **END PLT1** is a
  valid label, but **END PLOT1** is not. If an unlabeled **END** is used,
  it cannot start in column 1.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **PLOT** block are
described below.

**TTL=** *delim ptitl delim*
  Enter a one-character delimiter *delim* to
  signal the beginning of the title (132 characters maximum). The title is
  terminated when *delim* is encountered the second time. Acceptable
  delimiters include “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !.
  Default = title of the KENO case.

**PIC=** *wrd*
The plot type, *wrd*, is followed by one or more blanks
and must be one of the keywords listed below. The plot type is
initialized to MAT; the default is the value from the previous plot.

  is used to enter the Z coordinate of the lower right-hand
  corner of the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if any other
  coordinates are entered.

Direction cosines across the plot
  Enter direction numbers proportional to the direction cosines for the AX axis of the plot.
  The AX axis is from left to right across the plot. If any one of the AX direction cosines is entered,
  the other two are set to zero. The direction cosines are normalized by the code.

  **UAX=** *uax* is used to enter the X component of the direction
  cosines for the AX axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  **VAX=** *vax* is used to enter the Y component of the direction
  cosines for the AX axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  **WAX=** *wax* is used to enter the Z component of the direction

  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

Direction cosines down the plot
  Enter direction numbers proportional
  to the direction cosines for the DN axis of the plot.
  The DN axis is from top to bottom down the plot. If any one of the DN direction
  cosines is entered, the other two are set to zero. The direction cosines are normalized
  by the code.

  **UDN=** *udn* is used to enter the X component of the direction
  cosines for the DN axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

  cosines for the DN axis of the plot. Default = value from previous
  plot; initialized to zero if any other direction cosines are entered.

Scaling parameters
  Enter one or more scaling parameters to define the
  size of the plot.

  .. note:: If any of the scaling parameters are entered for a plot,
   the value of those that were not entered is recalculated. If none of
   the scaling parameters are specified for a plot, the values from the
   previous plot are used.

**DLX=** *dlx*
  is used to input the horizontal spacing between points on
  the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if
  **NAX** or **NDN** is entered.

**DLD=** *dld*
  is used to input the vertical spacing between points on
  the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero if
  **NAX** or **NDN** is entered.

.. note:: If either DLX or DLD is entered, the code will calculate the
  value of the other. If both are entered, the plot may be distorted.

**NAX=** *nax*
  is used to input the number of intervals to be printed
  across the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero
  if **DLX** or **DLD** is entered.

**NDN=** *ndn*
  is used to input the number of intervals to be printed
  down the plot. Default = value from previous plot; initialized to zero
  if **DLX** or **DLD** is entered.

Global scaling parameter

**LPI=** *lpi*
  is used to input a scaling factor used to control the
  horizontal to vertical proportionality of a plot or plots. SCALE 4.3 and
  later versions allow *lpi* to be input as a floating point number. For
  an undistorted character plot, *lpi* should be specified as the number
  of characters down the page that occupy the same distance as ten
  characters across the page. For an undistorted color plot, *lpi* should
  be entered as ten times the ratio of the vertical pixel dimension to the
  horizontal pixel dimension. The default value of *lpi* is 8.0 for a
  character plot and 10.0 for a color plot. *lpi*\ =10 will usually
  display an undistorted color plot.

  The value entered for *lpi* applies to all plot data following it
  until a new value of *lpi* is specified.

  .. note:: Plot data must include the specification of the upper left
    corner of the plot and the direction cosines across and down the
    plot.

    Additional data required to generate a plot are one of the following
    combinations:

    1. the lower right corner of the plot, the global scaling parameter,
    **LPI**, and one of the scaling parameters (**DLX**, **DLD**,
    **NAX**, **NDN**).

    2. the lower right corner of the plot, one of the scaling parameters
    related to the horizontal specifications of the plot (**DLX** or
    **NAX**), and one of the scaling parameters related to the vertical
    specification of the plot (**DLD** or **NDN**). **LPI**, even if
    specified will not be used.

    3. **NAX** and **NDN** and any two of **LPI, DLX**, and **DLD**. If
    **LPI, DLX**, and **DLD** are all specified, **LPI** is not used.

    The data required to generate a plot may be supplied from
    (1) defaulted values, (2) data from the previous plot, or (3) data
    that are specifically entered for the current plot.

Miscellaneous parameters
  Enter miscellaneous parameters

**RUN**\ = *run*
  is used to determine if the problem is executed or is
  terminated after data checking. A value of YES for *run* means the
  problem will be executed if all the data were acceptable. A value of NO
  specifies the problem will be terminated after data checking is
  completed. The default value of **RUN** is YES.

**PLT**\ = *plt*
  is used to specify if a plot is to be made. A value of
  YES for *plt* specifies that a plot is to be made. If plot data are
  entered, **PLT** is defaulted to YES.

.. note:: The parameters **RUN** and **PLT** can also be entered in the
  PARAMETER data. See :ref:`8-1-2-3`. It is recommended that these
  parameters be entered only in the parameter data block in order to
  ensure that the data printed in the “Logical Parameters” table are what
  is actually performed.

**SCR=** *src*
  This is used to determine the plot display method. The
  plot display method is specified by entering either YES or NO for *src*.
  The default value is YES. **SCR**\ =YES uses the color plot display
  method. **SCR**\ =NO uses the character plot display method. If **SCR**
  is entered more than once in a problem, the last value entered is the
  one that is used.

**NCH=** *delim char delim*
  Enter only if plots are to be made utilizing
  the character plot display method (**SCR**\ =NO). Enter a delimiter
  (i.e., “ , ‘ , \* , ^ , or !) to signal the beginning of character
  string *char*. The character string is terminated when the *delim*
  character is encountered the second time. Do not use the initial
  delimiter in the *char* string, as it will be read as terminating the
  string. *char* is a character string with each entry representing a
  plottable quantity (i.e., media {mixture} number, unit number, or bias
  ID). These are the characters that will be used in the plot. The first
  entry represents media, unit, or bias ID zero; the second entry
  represents the smallest media, unit, or bias ID used in the problem; the
  third entry represents the next larger media, unit, or bias ID used in
  the problem; etc. For example, assume **PIC**\ =MAT is specified, and
  15 mixtures are defined in the mixing table, and the geometry data use
  only mixtures 3 and 7. By default, a blank will be printed for mixture
  zero, a 1 will be printed for mixture 3, and a 2 will be printed for
  mixture 7. If you wish to print a zero for a void (mixture 0), a 3 for
  mixture 3, and a 7 for mixture 7, enter NCH=‘037’.

The default values of CHAR are the following:

  +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+
  | Quantity | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5     | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15 |

  this entry is used to define the colors to be used by the color plot.
  It may be entered only if plots are to be made utilizing the color
  plot display method (**SCR**\ =YES). After entering the keyword
  **CLR=**, 4 numbers are entered *N* times. The first number, *n*\ :sub:`1`,
  represents a media (mixture) number, unit number, or bias ID. The
  next three numbers, whose values can range from 0 through 255, define
  the *red, green, and blue* components of the color that will
  represent this *n*\ :sub:`1` in the plot. The sequence of 4 numbers is
  repeated until the colors associated with all of the media (mixture)
  numbers, unit numbers, or bias IDs used in the problem have been
  defined. The smallest number that can be entered for *n*\ :sub:`i` is −1,
  representing undefined regions in the plot. An *n\ i* of 0 represents
  void regions; *n*\ :sub:`i` of 1 represents the smallest media, unit, or
  bias ID used in the problem; *n*\ :sub:`i` of 2 represents the next larger
  media, unit, or bias ID used in the problem, etc. The color plot
  definition data are terminated by entering the keywords **END
  COLOR**. A total of 256 default colors are provided in :numref:`tab8-1-22`
  Two of those colors represent undefined regions, *n*\ :sub:`i`\ =-1*, as
  black and void regions, and *n*\ :sub:`i`\ =0 as gray. The remaining 254
  colors represent the default values for mixtures, bias IDs, or unit
  numbers used in the problem. If **num** is entered as **−1**, the
  next three numbers define the color that will be used to represent
  undefined regions of the plot. The default color for undefined
  regions is black, represented as 0 0 0. If *n*\ :sub:`i` is entered as 0,
  the next three numbers define the color that will represent void
  regions in the plot. The default color for void is gray, represented
  as 200 200 200. For example, assume a color plot is to be made for a
  problem that uses void regions and mixture numbers 1, 3, and 5. By
  default, the undefined regions (Index −1) will be black; void regions
  (Index 0) will be gray; the first mixture, mixture 1 (Index 1), will
  be medium blue; the next larger mixture, mixture 3 (Index 2), will be
  turquoise2; and the last mixture, mixture 5 (Index 3), will be
  green2. If these values are acceptable, data do not need to be
  entered for **CLR**\ =. If the user decides to define void to be
  white (255 255 255), mixture 1 to be red (255 0 0), mixture 3 to be
  bright blue (0 0 255), and mixture 5 to be green (0 255 0), then the
  following data could be entered:

  **CLR**\ =0 255 255 255 1 255 0 0 2 0 0 255 3 0 255 0 **END COLOR**

  In this example, the first number (0) defines the void, and the next
  three numbers are the *red, green, and blue* components that combine
  as the color white. The fifth number (1) represents the smallest
  mixture number (mixture 1), and the next three numbers are the *red,
  green, and blue* components of red. The ninth number (2) represents
  the next larger mixture number (mixture 3), and the next three
  numbers are the *red, green, and blue* components of bright blue. The
  thirteenth number (3) represents the next larger mixture number
  (mixture 5), and the next three numbers are the red, green, and blue
  components of green. The **END COLOR** terminates the color
  definition data. Because color data were not entered for *n\ i* of
  −1, undefined regions will be represented by the color black, the
  default specification from :numref:`tab8-1-22`. The *red, green, and blue*
  components of some bright colors are listed below.

Energy group boundary data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upper energy group boundary data in eV are entered to determine the
groups into which the tallies will be collected in the continuous energy
mode. For *G* groups *G*\ +1 entries are entered. The last entry is the
lower energy boundary of the last group. The values must be in
descending order. The parameter **NGP** is set equal to the number of
entries−1. The syntax is:

**READ ENERGY** *u*\ :sub:`1` …u\ *G* *u*\ :sub:`G+1` **END ENERGY**

*u*\ :sub:`1` … *u*\ :sub:`G`
  are the upper energy limits of energy groups 1 … *G*,
  respectively.

*u*\ :sub:`G+1`
  is the lower energy limit of energy group *G*.

Example:

  **READ ENERGY**

  2e7 1e5 1 1e−5

  **END ENERGY**

Defines a 3-group structure with group 1 (2e+7 eV to 1e+5 eV), group 2
(1e+5 eV to 1 eV), and group 3 (1 eV to 1e−5 eV) and sets **NGP**\ =3.

Energy group boundary data are optional. Default values for the energy
group boundaries in the calculations are determined as in the following
order:

  i.   Use energy group boundaries from **READ ENERGY** block if specified
       in the input. The number of entries in the **READ ENERGY** block is
       **NGP**\ +1.

  ii.  If only **NGP** is specified (in **READ PARAMETER**) in the input
       and **NGP** is equal to the number of energy groups in one of the
       SCALE neutron cross section libraries, the energy group structure
       from that library will be used.

  iii. If only **NGP** is specified (in **READ PARAMETER**) in the input
       and **NGP** is not equal to the number of energy groups in one of
       the SCALE neutron cross section libraries, **NGP** equal lethargy
       bins will be used.

  iv.  Use SCALE 238 group structure as default, **NGP**\ =238.

Volume data
~~~~~~~~~~~

If volumes are needed (for calculating fission densities, fluxes, etc.),
then the data necessary to determine them are entered. The syntax for
this block is:

**READ VOLUME** *p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N` **END VOLUME**

*p*\ :sub:`1` … *p*\ :sub:`N`
  are *N* parameters entered using keywords followed by the
  appropriate data.

The possible parameters that can be used in a **VOLUME** block are
described below.

**READVOL**\ =\ *vol*
  used to input the file name (up to 256 characters)
  of the file from which user-specified volumes are read. This is an
  optional parameter and only works for KENO-VI. The data are read in
  sections for each **UNIT** contained in the problem. First the keyword
  “\ **UNIT**\ ” is read, followed by the **UNIT** number. For that
  **UNIT** the data for each region containing material in the order shown
  in the input is read as follows: the keyword “\ **MEDIA**\ ” is read,
  followed by the mixture number, followed by the keyword “\ **VOL**\ =”,
  followed by the total volume for that region. Regions containing
  **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s are skipped. An example of the data
  contained in a volume file is given later in this section.

**TYPE**\ =\ *vcalc*
  used to determine the type of volume calculation.
  *vcalc* can have the values:

   NONE: (only works in KENO-VI, where it is also the default) No volume
   calculation, volumes are set to –1.0 (only in KENO-VI).

   TRACE: A trapezoidal integration will be performed (only in KENO‑VI).

   RANDOM: A Monte Carlo integration will be performed.

**NRAYS**\ =\ *ntotal*
  the number of intervals used in the trapezoidal
  integration (default 100,000). Used only with TYPE=TRACE (KENO-VI).

**BATCHES**\ =\ *nloop*
  the number of batches to be used in the
  Monte Carlo integration (default 500). Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**POINTS**\ =nplp
  the number of points per batch used in the Monte Carlo
  integration (default 1000). Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**XP**\ =\ *xp*
  the plus X face of the encompassing cuboid.

**XM**\ =\ *xm*
  the minus X face of the encompassing cuboid.

**YP**\ =\ *yp*
  the plus Y face of the encompassing cuboid.

**YM**\ =\ *ym*
  the minus Y face of the encompassing cuboid.

**ZP**\ =\ *zp*
  the plus Z face of the encompassing cuboid.

**ZM**\ =\ *zm*
  the minus Z face of the encompassing cuboid.

**SAMPLE_DEN=**\ *sampleden*
  the density of sampling points per
  cm\ :sup:`3` per batch. Used only with TYPE=RANDOM.

**IFACE** =\ *fname*
  the face of the enclosing cuboid where the
  trapezoidal integration will be performed. Enter either **XFACE**,
  **YFACE**, or **ZFACE**. KENO-VI will integrate over the face with the
  smallest area by default. This allows specifying a different face. Used
  only for **TYPE**\ =TRACE (KENO-VI).

The volume parameters include specifying the type of calculation to
determine the volumes and additional parameters needed for the selected
type. In KENO-VI the default type is NONE (i.e., no volume calculation
will be performed), and the volumes for regions not containing
**HOLE**\ s or **ARRAY**\ s will be set to -1.0. No other data are
needed for this type.

In KENO-VI the volume data may be entered for any or all regions within
the geometry data by placing the keyword **VOL**\ = followed by the
total volume of that region in the problem at the end of the **MEDIA**
card. See :ref:`8-1-2-4` (Geometry Data) for more details.

For KENO-VI, in the same problem, volumes may be entered using a
combination of three methods: (1) in the geometry data using **VOL**\ =,
(2) read from a volume file, and (3) calculated. The calculated volumes
(method 3) are obtained for both the regions, and the meshes are defined
by a grid (such as in TSUNAMI runs). As for KENO V.a, the mesh volumes
must always be calculated (i.e., there is no method to input the mesh
volumes). If volumes are entered or calculated using more than one
method, the following hierarchy is used to determine which volume is
used for the regions.

1. Volumes entered as part of a **MEDIA** card using **VOL**\ = are
   always used.

2. Volumes read from the volume file are used if that volume for the
   region was not specified using VOL= following a **MEDIA** card.

3. Calculated volumes are used if they are not specified using
   **VOL**\ = and if there is no volume file or data for that region on
   the volume file.

4. Volumes that have not been set or calculated will be set to –1.0.
   This may result in negative fluxes and fission densities for these
   regions.

5. Volumes are only calculated for regions containing material. Regions
   containing **ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s have no volume. Those volumes
   are associated with the **UNIT** contained in the **ARRAY** or
   **HOLE**.

In KENO V.a, the region volumes are always calculated by the code
without the user’s intervention. This is possible because KENO V.a has
no region intersections, so calculation of the volumes is always
possible using analytical methods. The use of the (RANDOM) calculated
volumes using the **VOLUME** block is then only justified when the user
needs to calculate the volumes defined by a grid, such as for TSUNAMI
calculations.

When volumes are calculated using either RANDOM or TRACE, then a file
containing volumes and named \_volxxxx (where xxxx is an 18-digit number
with the leftmost unused digits padded with zeros) is created in the
temporary directory. The program searches the temporary directory for a
file name beginning with \_vol. If it is not found, the volume file that
is created is named \_vol000000000000000000. If a file exists, then a
new file will be created where the file number is the largest number
associated with a previous volume file incremented by 1. The file is
automatically copied to the user directory with the input file base name
prepended to it, such as inputfile.volxxxx.volumes.

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
in which volumes are being calculated using ray tracing. The number of
rays used is set to one million, and if the outer unit volume is not a
cuboid, then a cuboid will be placed around the global region prior to
calculating volumes.

::

  read volume
  type=trace nrays=1000000
  XP=10  XM=-15 YP=15  YM=-15  ZP=15  ZM=-15
  end volume

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
where volumes are being calculated using random sampling. The number of
particles per batch is set to 100,000, and the number of batches used is
set to 500. After being calculated, the volume data will be written to a
file in the temporary directory as discussed above.

::

  read volume
  type=random points=100000 batches=500
  XP=10  XM=-10  YP=15  YM=-15  ZP=25  ZM=15
  end volume

Below is an example of the **VOLUME** data block associated with a case
where volumes are both read in from the file VOLUME_DATA and calculated
using random sampling. The number of particles per generation is set to
1,000,000, and the number of generations used is set to 500. The file
VOLUME_DATA must be formatted as shown below. The calculated volume data
are written in the temporary working directory to a file as discussed
above. Calculating volume data for some volume regions and providing
input volume data for others may be useful if only part of the volume
data is known and the remaining data need to be calculated.

::

  read volume
  type=random points=1000000 batches=500
  readvol=volume_DAta
  end volume

Example volume file VOLUME_DATA:

::

  UNIT 1
     MEDIA 1 VOL=110.0
     MEDIA 2 VOL=2435.8
     MEDIA 2 VOL=3242.9
  UNIT 2
     MEDIA 2 VOL=342.8
     MEDIA 0 VOL=4235.0

Below is an example of a sample problem in which volumes are being
calculated using random sampling. The number of particles per generation
is set to 100,000, and the number of generations used is set to 500.
After being calculated, the **VOLUME** data will be written as described
above.

  maximum cell boundary in the x direction, default =
  1.

**YMIN**\ =\ *ymin*
  minimum cell boundary in the y direction, default =
  0.

**YMAX**\ =\ *ymax*
  maximum cell boundary on the y direction, default =
  1.

**ZMIN**\ =\ *zmin*
  minimum cell boundary in the z direction, default =
  0.

**ZMAX=**\ *zmax*
  maximum cell boundary in the z direction, default = 1.

**XPLANES**\ =\ *xplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the x direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**YPLANES**\ =\ *yplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the y direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**ZPLANES**\ =\ *zplanes*
  the cell boundaries in the z direction
  followed by end, default = 0, 1 end.

**XLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsx *x*\ :sub:`min` *x*\ :sub:`max`
  generate y-z planes from
  x\ :sub:`min` to x\ :sub:`max` creating *numcellsx* intervals.

**YLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsy *y*\ :sub:`min` *y*\ :sub:`max`
  generate x-z planes from
  y\ :sub:`min` to y\ :sub:`max`, creating *numcellsy* intervals.

**ZLINEAR**\ =\ *numcellsz *z*\ :sub:`min` *z*\ :sub:`max`
  generate x-y planes from
  z\ :sub:`min` to z\ :sub:`max`, creating *numcellsz* intervals.

**TITLE**\ =\ *title*
  optional title for this mesh grid. Only used in
  KENO if an error in the grid causes a debug print.

If *numx, xmin, xmax* are entered, then the code will calculate *numx*
equally spaced cells in the x direction between *xmin* and *xmax*.

If *xplanes* is entered, then the code will count the number of unique
*xplanes*, and order them from minimum to maximum, deleting any
duplicates.

If the user inputs both sets of data, then the code will use the
*xplanes* data.

If *xplanes* and *xlinear* are both entered, then the code will retain
all unique planes from *xplanes* and all *xlinear* entries provided. The
above also applies to Y and Z.

**NOTE**: The user **MUST** set the minimum and maximum values in each
direction so that the actual geometry is totally covered by the mesh for
mesh flux tally that is used in TSUNAMI sensitivity calculations.

KENO checks for and eliminates duplicate or nearly duplicate planes.

The user may specify multiple mesh grids; each must be defined in
separate **READ GRID** blocks. In this case, each grid should have
different *N* (grid ID number). See :ref:`8-1-3-10` for details and
samples.

Reaction data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reaction data block is used to specify the type of tally (e.g.,
reaction rates, flux, and few group reaction cross sections) and the
reaction/nuclide pairs in any mixture used in the problem for reaction
tally calculations. This block is operational only with the continuous
energy mode, and it provides the specifications for reaction rate,
neutron flux, and reaction cross section tallies. See :ref:`8-1-6-6` for
more details. For multigroup KENO calculations, use KMART5 or KMART6,
which are described in the KMART section of the SCALE manual.

A reaction data block consists of REACTION FILTERS, TALLY TYPE, ENERGY
GROUP BOUNDARIES, and OUTPUT EDITS. These data types can be entered in
any order. A combination of parameters for describing the REACTION
FILTERS and TALLY TYPE must be entered for any reaction or cross section
tally calculation. ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES and OUTPUT EDITS data are
optional. Tally calculations can be performed for multiple reactions
specified by the REACTION FILTERS. Only one energy grid, either
specified with the data in ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES or from the READ
ENERGY block or from the code defaults, is used for all reaction tally
calculations. To provide data for the continuous energy depletion
calculations, another energy grid can be specified and used for tallying
only the mixture flux.

Enter REACTION DATA in the form:

**READ REACTION** *REACTION FILTERS [TALLY TYPE] [ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES][OUTPUT EDITS]* **END REACTION**

*REACTION FILTERS*
  define a reaction map that is used in reaction tally
  calculations. The *REACTION FILTERS* must be entered in the following
  order; mixture data (**MIX** or **MIXLIST**) followed by nuclide data
  (**NUC** or **NUCLIST**) followed by reaction IDs (**MT** or
  **MTLIST**). Each filter is defined using a combination of the following
  keywords:

**MIX**\ =\ *mixnum*
  Mixture number, no default value. Specified mixture
  number must exist in the mixing table and be used in the problem for a
  valid filter generation. A wildcard “\ *\**\ ” can be used to define a
  filter applicable for all mixtures in the problem.

**MIXLIST** *mixnum*\ :sub:`1` *mixnum*\ :sub:`2` … *mixnum*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of mixture
  numbers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified mixture numbers
  must exist in the mixing table and be used in the problem for a valid
  reaction tally calculation. Within each filter, use either **MIX** or
  **MIXLIST**, but not both.

**NUC**\ =\ *nucid*
  Nuclide identifier, no default value. Specified
  nuclide must be a constituent of the mixtures used in this filter
  definition (specified with MIX or MIXLIST). A wildcard “*” can be used
  to define a filter applicable for all nuclides in each mixture in this
  filter definition. Nuclide identifiers are listed for all isotopes in
  the Standard Composition Library section of the SCALE manual (see :ref:`7-2`).

**NUCLIST** *nucid*\ :sub:`1` *nucid*\ :sub:`2` … *nucid*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of nuclide
  identifiers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified nuclides
  must be the constituents of the mixtures used in this filter definition
  (specified by **MIX** or **MIXLIST**). Within each filter, use either
  **NUC** or **NUCLIST**, but not both.

**MT**\ =\ *mt*
  Reaction MT number, no default value. Specified reaction
  MT number should be available for the nuclides defined in this filter
  definition (specified by **NUC** or **NUCLIST**). Otherwise, the code
  skips the filter definition with this given reaction MT. A wildcard “*”
  can be used to define a filter with all reaction MTs. Valid SCALE
  library MT values are listed in the SCALE Cross Section Libraries
  section of the SCALE manual (see Appendix A of :ref:`11-1`).

**MTLIST** *mt*\ :sub:`1` *mt*\ :sub:`2` … *mt*\ :sub:`N`\ **END**
  A list of reaction **MT**
  numbers followed by *end,* no default values. Specified MT numbers
  should be available for the nuclides defined in this filter definition
  (specified by **MIX** or **MIXLIST**). Otherwise, KENO skips that
  reaction specified in the filter for the reaction tally calculations.
  Within each filter, use either **MT** or **MTLIST**, but not both.

A reaction filter consists of either single or multiple mixture, nuclide
and reaction definitions. A valid reaction filter starts with mixture
specification, followed by nuclide specification, and ends with reaction
specification. Mixture(s) must be specified with either **MIX** or
**MIXLIST** keywords. Nuclide(s) in these mixtures must be entered with
either **NUC** or **NUCLIST**, and reactions for each nuclide must be
specified with either **MT** or **MTLIST**.

Mixture, nuclide, and reaction number are required for mixture average
fluxes, even though the nuclide and reaction numbers are not used for
the neutron flux tallies.

Multiple reaction filter definitions are allowed. KENO processes all the
definitions and creates a reaction map based on them. The following
examples demonstrate the reaction filter specifications for different
problems. In these examples, reaction filters are specified based on the
following composition data used in the problem:

Parameters of TALLY TYPE are logical parameters used to select
quantities (reaction cross section, reaction rate, and mixture flux)
that are tallied for the given problem. The user specifies any
combination of these TALLY TYPEs once for all filters:

**XSTALLY**\ *=lCEXSTally*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that reaction cross
   sections be tallied for the reactions listed in *REACTION FILTERS*.
   The default value of **XSTALLY** is NO. Computed reaction cross
   sections are saved in a file named *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs.0* in
   RTNDIR, which is a SCALE environment variable for the directory from
   where the calculation was started. BASENAME is a SCALE environment
   variable that is the base name of the input file. (BASENAME is equal
   to *“mytest”* if the SCALE input name is *“mytest.inp.”*)

**RRTALLY**\ *=lCERRTally*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that reaction rates be
   tallied for the reactions listed in *REACTION FILTERS*. The default
   value of RRTALLY is NO. Computed reaction rates are saved in a file
   named *BASENAME_keno_micro_rr.0* in RTNDIR.

.. note:: KENO combines and saves reaction rate and reaction cross
  section tallies to the same file, named *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_rr.0* in
  RTNDIR, if both **XSTALLY** and **RRTALLY** are set to YES.

**MIXFLX**\ *=lCEMixFlux*
   Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that mixture fluxes are to
   be tallied for the mixtures listed in *REACTION FILTERS*. The default
   value of **MIXFLX** is NO. Computed mixture fluxes are saved in a
   file named *BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux.0* in RTNDIR.

   Mixture, nuclide, and reaction number are required for mixture
   average fluxes, even though the nuclide and reaction numbers are not
   used for the neutron flux tallies.

::

  READ REACTION
 	    MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	    XSTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT**\ =18) of

  READ REACTION
 	    MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	    XSTALLY=YES RRTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT=**\ 18) of
:sup:`235`\ U in mixture 10, for tallying reaction rates as well as the
reaction cross sections.

.. note:: Computed data are saved in files named
  *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_rr.0*

Example-13:

::

  READ REACTION
 	  MIX=10 NUC=92235  MT=18
	   XSTALLY=YES MIXFLX=YES
 	   …
  END REACTION

Defines a reaction filter, which uses fission reaction (**MT=**\ 18) of
:sup:`235`\ U in mixture 10, for tallying reaction cross sections. In
addition, mixture flux is tallied for mixture 10 given in this reaction
filter.

.. note:: Computed data are saved in files named
  *BASENAME_keno_micro_xs.0*, and *BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux.0*,
  respectively.

*ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES* data define energy group structure other than
the defaults for tallying both reaction cross sections/reaction rates
and mixture fluxes.

**ENER_XS** *e\ 1 e\ 2 e\ 3 …*\ **END** Upper energy boundary for each
group. The last entry is the lower energy boundary of the last group.
For N groups, there are N+1 entries. Entries must be in descending
order. This may be specified once in the REACTION block and, if used, is
applied to all cross section and reaction rate tallies.

**ENER_FLX** *e\ 1 e\ 2 e\ 3 …*\ **END** Upper energy boundary for each
group, default is **NGP**-group data. The last entry is the lower energy
boundary of the last group. For N groups, there are N +1 entries.
Entries must be in descending order. This may be specified once in the
REACTION block and, if used, is applied to all mixture flux tallies.

.. note:: Default values for the energy group boundaries in reaction
  tally calculations are determined as in the order described in :ref:`8-1-2-12`.

Example-14: (no **READ ENERGY** block, no **NGP** in **READ PARAMETER**
block, no energy group

::

  READ REACTION
 	  MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
	   MTLIST 16 17 18 END
	    MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES
 	    …
  END REACTION

Default SCALE 238-group energy structure is used for tallying both
mixture flux and reaction cross sections.

 	   …
  END REACTION

2-group energy structure given in **READ ENERGY** block is used for
tallying both mixture flux and reaction cross sections.

Example-16: (**NGP** is set in **READ PARAMETER** block)

::

  READ PARAMETER
 		 …

	   MTLIST 16 17 18 END
	   MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES
 	   …
  END REACTION

4-group energy group structure (4-equal lethargy bins) is used for
tallying both mixture flux and reaction cross sections.

Example-17:

::

  READ REACTION
     	MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
    	MTLIST 16 17 18 END

     	 …
  END REACTION

3-group energy group structure given in **READ REACTION** block is used
for tallying reaction cross sections, and default SCALE 238 group energy
structure is used for tallying mixture flux.

Example-18:

::

  READ REACTION
     	MIX=10 NUCLIST 92235 92238 END
    	MTLIST 16 17 18 END
    	MIXFLX=YES XSTALLY=YES

    	ENER_XS 20.E6 1.0 1.E-4 END
     	 …
  END REACTION

2-group energy group structure given in **READ REACTION** block is used
for tallying reaction cross sections, and 3-group energy group structure
given in **READ REACTION** block is used for tallying mixture flux.

Parameters of *OUTPUT EDITS* are logical parameters used to print
reaction tallies and mixture fluxes in separate files. These parameters
are optional parameters.

**PRNTXS**\ *=lCEprintXS* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that
reaction cross sections tallies for each mixture be written in separate
files in RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_micro_xs_mix{mixnum}.0, mixnum* is the
mixture numbers specified in the reaction filters)\ *.* The default
value of **PRNTXS** is NO.

**PRNTRR**\ *=lCEprintRR* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES specifies that
reaction rate tallies for each mixture be written in separate files in
RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_micro_rr_mix{mixnum}.0, mixnum* is the mixture
numbers specified in the reaction filters)\ *.* The default value of
**PRNTRR** is NO.

**PRNTFLX**\ *=lCEprintMixFlux* Enter YES or NO. A value of YES
specifies that mixture flux tallies for each mixture be written in
separate files in RTNDIR (*BASENAME_keno_mixture_flux_mix{mixnum}.0,
mixnum* is the mixture numbers specified in the reaction filters)\ *.*
The default value of **PRNTFLX** is NO.

Notes for Keno Users
--------------------

This section provides assorted tips designed to assist the KENO user with problem mockups.
Some information concerning methods used by KENO is also included.

.. _8-1-3-1:

Data entry
~~~~~~~~~~

The KENO data is entered in blocks that begin and end with keywords as
described in :ref:`8-1-2-1`. Only one set of parameter data can be
entered for a problem. However, for other data blocks, it is possible to
enter more than one block of the same kind of data. When this is done,
only the last block of that kind of data is retained for use by the
problem, except for the GRID block for which all blocks are retained.

Within data blocks, a number, x, can be repeated n times by specifying
nRx, n*x, or n$x.

Numbers in engineering notation may be specified with or without an “E”
between the base and the exponent. For example; 0.0011 may be specified
as 1.1e-3 or as 1.1-3.

.. _8-1-3-1-1:

Multiple and scattered entries in the mixing table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the following examples, assume 1001 is the nuclide ID for hydrogen,
8016 is the nuclide ID for oxygen, 92235 is the nuclide ID for
:sup:`235`\ U, and 92238 is the nuclide ID for :sup:`238`\ U. If a given
nuclide ID is used more than once in the same mixture, the result is the
summing of all the number densities associated with that nuclide. For
example:

**MIX**\ =1 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 92235 1.1e-3 8016
1.8e-2

would be the same as entering:

**MIX**\ =1 92235 4.41e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 8016 1.8e-2

A belated entry for a mixture can be made as follows:

**MIX**\ =1 1001 6.6e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 MIX=1 8016
3.3e-2

This is the same as entering:

**MIX**\ =1 1001 6.6e-2 8016 3.3e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3

.. _8-1-3-1-2:

Multiple entries in geometry data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Individual geometry regions cannot be replaced by adding an additional
description. However, entire unit descriptions can be replaced by adding
a new description having the same unit number. The last description
entered for a unit is used in the calculation. For example, the
following geometry descriptions are equivalent in KENO V.a and KENO-VI,
respectively:

In KENO V.a:

The order of entry for **UNIT** descriptions is not important because
the **UNIT** number is assigned as the value following the word
**UNIT**. They do not need to be entered sequentially, and they do not
need to be numbered sequentially. It is perfectly acceptable to enter
**UNIT**\ s 2, 3, and 5, omitting Units 1 and 4 as long as **UNIT**\ s 1
and 4 are not referenced in the problem. It is also acceptable to
scramble the order of entry as in entering **UNIT**\ s 3, 2, and 5.

Parameter input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the parameter data block is entered for a problem, the same keyword
may be entered several times. The last value that is entered is used in
the problem. Data may be entered as follows:

::

  READ PARAM  FLX=YES NPG=1000 TME=0.5 TME=1.0
  NPG=50 TME=10.0 FLX=NO
  NPG=500
  END PARA

This will result in the problem having **FLX=NO**, **TME=10.0**, and
**NPG=500**. It may be more convenient for the user to insert a new
value than to change the existing data.

Certain parameter default values should not be overridden unless the
user has a very good reason to do so. These parameters are as follows:

   1. **X1D=** which defines the number of extra 1-D cross sections. The
   use of extra 1‑D cross sections—other than the use of the fission
   cross section for calculating the average number of neutrons per
   fission—requires programming changes to the code;

   2. **NFB=** which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
   in the fission bank (the fission bank is where the information
   related to a fission is stored);

   3. **XFB=** which defines the number of extra positions in the
   fission bank;

   4. **NBK=** which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
   in the neutron bank (the neutron bank contains information about each
   history);

   5. **XNB=** which defines the number of extra positions in the
   neutron bank;

   6. **WTH=** which defines the factor that determines when splitting
   occurs;

   7. **WTA=** which defines the default average weight given to a
   neutron that survives Russian roulette;

   8. **WTL=** which defines the factor that determines when Russian
   roulette is played; and

   9. **LNG=** which sets the maximum words of storage available to the
   program.

It is recommended that **BUG=**, the flag for printing debug
information, **never** be set to YES. The user would have to look at the
FORTRAN coding to determine what information is printed. **BUG**\ =YES
prints massive amounts of sparsely labeled information. The user should
only rarely consider using **TRK**\ =YES. This generates thousands of
lines of well-labeled output that provides information about each
history at key locations during the tracking procedure. All other
parameters can be changed at will to provide features the user wishes to
activate.

.. _8-1-3-4:

Cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In multi-energy group mode, KENO always uses cross sections from a mixed
cross section data file. The format of this file is the Monte Carlo
processed cross section file. A mixed cross section file can be created
by previous KENO run, or  by using an AMPX working format library and
entering mixing table data in KENO.

.. _8-1-3-4-1:

Use a mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library (premixed cross section
data file) from a previous KENO case may be used. This file is specified
using the parameter **XSC**\ =. If a mixing table data block is entered,
the premixed cross section data file will be rewritten. Therefore, a
mixing table should not be entered if a premixed cross section data file
is used. The user should verify that the mixtures created by a previous
KENO case are consistent with those used in the geometry data of the
problem.

.. _8-1-3-4-2:

Use an AMPX working format library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an AMPX working format library is used, it must be specified using
the parameter **LIB**\ =, and mixing table data must always be entered.
IDs used in the mixing table must match the IDs on the AMPX working
format library. The user must provide a file with the correct cross
sections with a name that matches the pattern ftNNf001, with NN being
the number of the logical unit.

.. _8-1-3-4-3:

Number of scattering angles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The number of scattering angles is defaulted to 1 (defaulted to 2 when
KENO-VI is run as part of the CSAS6 sequence). This stand alone default
is not adequate for many applications. The user should specify the
scattering angle to be consistent with the cross sections being used.
The number of scattering angles is entered in the cross section mixing
table by using the keyword **SCT**\ =. See :ref:`8-1-2-10`.

The order of the last Legendre coefficient to be preserved in the
scattering distribution is equal to (2 × SCT − 1). **SCT**\ =1 could be
used with a P\ :sub:`1` cross section set such as the 16-group
Hansen-Roach cross section library, and **SCT**\ =2, for a P\ :sub:`3`
cross section set such as the SCALE 27-group cross section library.
ENDF/B-V cross section libraries such as the 44-group or 238-group
libraries contain many nuclides having P\ :sub:`5` cross section sets.
Isotropic scattering is achieved by entering **SCT**\ =0.

.. _8-1-3-4-4:

Cross section message cutoff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cross section message cutoff value, *pbxs*, is defaulted to
3 × 10\ :sup:`−5`. Warning messages generated when errors are
encountered in the P\ :sub:`L` expansion of the group-to-group transfers
will be suppressed if the P\ :sub:`0` cross section for that particular
energy transfer is less than *pbxs*. The value of *pbxs* is specified in
the cross section mixing table by using the keyword **EPS**\ =. See
:ref:`8-1-2-10`.

The default value of *pbxs* is sufficient to assure that warning
messages will not be printed for most of the SCALE P\ :sub:`1` and
P\ :sub:`3` cross section libraries. However, the v7.0-238n library may
print a few errors if P\ :sub:`5` cross sections are specified.

The error messages below were printed for a problem using the 238-group
cross section library and *pbxs* = 3.0 × 10\ :sup:`–5`. If the default
value of *pbxs* allows too many warning messages to be printed, a value
can be determined which does not print the error messages from the
printed messages by choosing a number larger than the P\ :sub:`0`
component on the first line, as shown below.

For the following messages, **EPS**\ =6.9e−5 would cause all three
messages to be suppressed. A value less than 5.615159e−5 and greater
than 4.767635e−5 would suppress the second message, and a value less
than 6.855362e−5 and greater than 5.615159e−5 would suppress the first
two messages.

The user does not need to attempt to suppress all these messages. They
are printed to inform the user of the fact that the moments of the
angular distribution are not moments of a valid probability
distribution. The original P\ :sub:`n` coefficients and their moments
are listed in lines 3–6 of the message. Lines 7–10 list the new
corrected moments and their corresponding P\ :sub:`n` coefficients.

The weights and angles printed in lines 11–13 were generated from the
corrected moments. The last two lines of the message list the moments
generated from those weights and angles. They should match line 8, which
lists the moments corresponding to the generated distribution.

For most criticality problems, the first moment contributions are much
more significant than the contributions of the higher order moments.
Thus, the higher order moments may not affect the results significantly.
The user may compare the original moments and corrected moments to make
a judgment as to the significance of the change in the moments.

Mixing table
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mixtures can be used in defining other mixtures. When defining mixture
numbers, care should be taken to avoid using a mixture number that is
identical to a nuclide ID number if the mixture is to be used in
defining another mixture. If a mixture number is defined more than once,
it results in a summing effect.

The nuclide mixing loop is done before the mixture mixing loop, which
performs mixing in the order of data entry. Thus, the order of mixing
mixtures into other mixtures is important because a mixture must be
defined before it can be used in another mixture. Some examples of
correct and incorrect mixing are shown below, using 1001 as the nuclide
ID for hydrogen, 8016 as the nuclide ID for oxygen, 92235 as the nuclide
ID for :sup:`235`\ U, and 92238 as the nuclide ID for :sup:`238`\ U.

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT USAGE

::

    1.	READ MIXT
          MIX=1 1001 6.6e-2  8016 3.3e-2
          MIX=2 1 0.5
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water and mixture 2 being half-density water.

::

    2.	READ MIXT
          MIX=1  2  0.5
          MIX=3  1  0.5
          MIX=2  1001  6.6e-2  8016  3.3e-2
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being half-density water, mixture 2 being
full-density water, and mixture 3 being quarter-density water. Because
the nuclide mixing loop is done first, mixture 2 is created first and is
available to create mixture 1, which is then available to create
mixture 3.

::

    3.  READ MIXT
          MIX=1   1001   6.6e-2   8016   3.3e-2
          MIX=2   92235   7.5e-4   92238   2.3e-2  8016   4.6e-2  1 .01
       END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water and mixture 2 being uranium oxide containing 0.01 density water.

::

    4.  READ MIXT
          MIX=1    1001  6.6e-2    8016  3.3e-2
          MIX=2  92235  4.4e-2  92238  2.6e-3
          MIX=1  1  0.5
        END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being water at 1.5 density (1001 9.9e-2 and 8016 4.95e-2)
and mixture 2 is highly enriched uranium metal.

EXAMPLES OF INCORRECT USAGE


::

      1.	READ MIXT
            MIX=3  1  0.75
            MIX=1  2  0.5
            MIX=2  1001  6.6e-2  8016  3.3e-2
          END MIXT

Here the intent is for mixture 2 to be full-density water, mixture 1 to
be half-density water, and mixture 3 to be 3/8 (0.75 × 0.5) density
water. Instead, the result for mixture 3 is a void, mixture 1 is
half-density water, and mixture 2 is full-density water. This is because
the nuclide mixing loop is done first, thus defining mixture 2. The
mixture mixing loop is done next. Mixture 3 is defined to be mixture 1
multiplied by 0.75, but since mixture 1 has not been defined yet, 0.75
of zero is zero. Mixture 1 is then defined to be mixture 2 multiplied by
0.5. If the definition of mixture 1 preceded the definition of
mixture 3, as in item (2) under examples of correct usage, it would work
correctly.

::

      2.	READ MIXT
            MIX=1         1001   6.6e-2     8016     3.3e-2
            MIX=1001 92235   4.4e-2   92238   2.6e-3
            MIX=2   1001   0.5
          END MIXT

This results in mixture 1 being full-density water, mixture 1001 being
uranium metal, and mixture 2 being hydrogen with a number density of 0.5
because 1001 is the nuclide ID number for hydrogen. When a mixture
number is identical to a nuclide ID and is used in mixing, that number
is assumed to be a nuclide ID rather than a mixture number. The intent
was for mixture 1 to be full-density water, mixture 1001 to be uranium
metal, and mixture 2 to be half-density uranium metal.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

In general, KENO geometry descriptions consist of (1) geometry data
(:ref:`8-1-2-4`) defining the geometrical shapes present in the problem,
and (2) array data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`) defining the placement of the units
that were defined in the geometry data. The geometry data block is
prefaced by **READ GEOM**, and the array data block is prefaced by
**READ ARRAY**.

When a 3-D geometrical configuration is described as KENO geometry data,
it may be necessary to describe portions of the configuration
individually. These individual partial descriptions of the configuration
are called **UNIT**\ s. KENO geometry modeling is subject to the
following restrictions:

1. Units are composed of regions. These regions are created using
      geometric bodies and surfaces (**shape**\ s) that are previously
      defined.

   1. In KENO-VI the geometric bodies and surfaces may intersect.
      Regions are defined relative to the geometric bodies and surfaces
      in a **UNIT**. **HOLE**\ s provide a means of creating complex
      geometries in a **UNIT** and then inserting the **UNIT** into
      existing **UNIT**\ s. For complex geometries the use of
      **HOLE**\ s may decrease the CPU time required for the problem.

   2. In KENO V.a, each geometry region in a **UNIT** must completely
      enclose all geometry regions which precede it. Boundaries of the
      surfaces of the regions may be shared or tangent, but they must
      not intersect. The use of **HOLE**\ s in KENO V.a provides an
      exception to this complete enclosure rule. The use of **HOLE**\ s
      in KENO V.a will increase the CPU time required for the problem.

2. All geometrical surfaces must be describable in KENO V.a as spheres,
      hemispheres, cylinders, hemicylinders, cubes, cuboids, or as a set
      of quadratic equations in KENO-VI.

3. When specifying an **ARRAY**, each **UNIT** used in a cuboidal
      **ARRAY** must have a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as its outer region
      (this is the only option in KENO V.a); a hexprism as the outer
      boundary if it is a hexagonal, triangular, or shexagonal
      **ARRAY**; a rhexprism as the outer boundary if it is a rhexagonal
      **ARRAY**; and a dodecahedron as the outer boundary if it is a
      dodecahedral **ARRAY**. In addition, the outer boundary of a
      **UNIT** cannot be rotated or translated in KENO V.a.

4. When several **UNIT**\ s are used to describe an **ARRAY**, the
      adjacent faces of the **UNIT**\ s in contact with each other must
      be the same size and shape.

5. **UNIT**\ s are placed directly into regions using **HOLE**\ s. As
      many **HOLE**\ s as will fit without intersecting other
      **HOLE**\ s, nested **ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s, or the **UNIT**
      **BOUNDARY** can be placed in a **UNIT** without intersecting each
      other. In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s cannot intersect any of the
      regions within the **UNIT** in which they are placed. **HOLE**\ s
      are described in more detail in :ref:`8-1-3-6-1`, and nested
      **HOLE**\ s are described in :ref:`8-1-3-6-2`.

6. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be required to describe a complicated
      system. In KENO V.a, only one **ARRAY** may be placed directly
      into a **UNIT**. However, multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be placed in a
      **UNIT** by placing the **ARRAY**\ s in other **UNIT**\ s and
      placing those **UNIT**\ s in the original **UNIT** using
      **HOLE**\ s. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s may be placed directly into a
      **UNIT** in KENO-VI. These **UNIT**\ s may then be used to create
      other **ARRAY**\ s, or they may be placed in other **UNIT**\ s
      using **HOLE**\ s. **UNIT**\ s placed in **ARRAY**\ s or
      **HOLE**\ s that are contained in other **HOLE**\ s or
      **ARRAY**\ s are said to be nested. The nesting level of a
      **UNIT** is the number of **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s between the
      **ARRAY** or **HOLE** in the **GLOBAL UNIT** or **ARRAY** and the
      **UNIT**. Multiple **ARRAY**\ s are described in more detail in
      :ref:`8-1-3-6-3`.

The KENO V.a geometry package allows any applicable **shape** to be
enclosed by any other applicable **shape**, subject only to the complete
enclosure restriction. The KENO-VI geometry package allows any **shape**
describable using quadratic equations to be enclosed or intersected by
any other allowable **shape**. The implication of this type of
description is that the entire volume between two adjacent geometrical
surfaces contains only one mixture, **HOLE**, or **ARRAY**. A void is
specified by a mixture ID of zero. If **HOLE**\ s are present in the
volume between two surfaces, the volume of that region is reduced by the
**HOLE**\ ’s volume(s).

In KENO V.a geometry, if the problem requires several **UNIT**\ s to
describe its geometrical characteristics, each **UNIT** that is used in
an **ARRAY** must have a rectangular parallelepiped as its outer
surface. This restriction is relaxed in KENO-VI, where the outer surface
may be a rectangular parallelepiped, a hexagonal prism, a 90º rotated
hexagonal prism, or a dodecahedron, but all units placed in an array
must use the same shape as their outer **BOUNDARY**. In order to
describe the composite overall geometrical characteristics of the
problem, these **UNIT**\ s may be arranged in a rectangular **ARRAY**
for KENO V.a geometry, or in either a rectangular, hexagonal,
shexagaonal, rhexagonal, or dodecahedral **ARRAY** for KENO-VI geometry.
This is done by specifying the number of units in the X, Y, and
Z directions. If more than one **UNIT** is involved, data must be
entered to define the number assigned to the **ARRAY** and the placement
of the individual **UNIT**\ s in the **ARRAY**. The **ARRAY** number,
the number of **UNIT**\ s in the X, Y, and Z directions, and the
placement data are called *array data* (:ref:`8-1-2-5`).

In the KENO V.a geometry description, the surrounding regions of any
**shape** may be placed around an **ARRAY**, and they may consist of any
number of regions in any order subject to the complete enclosure
restriction. **ARRAY**\ s are positioned relative to the **UNIT ORIGIN**
by specifying the location of the most negative point in the array, i.e.
the most negative X, most negative Y, and most negative Z corner of the
**ARRAY**. In KENO-VI geometry, an **ARRAY** may be placed in a region
of any shape if the region boundary is contained within the **ARRAY** or
shares the **ARRAY** boundary and does not cut across nested
**ARRAY**\ s or **HOLE**\ s. In this case, only the section of the
**ARRAY** contained within the region is recognized by the problem.
**ARRAY**\ s are positioned relative to the **UNIT** **ORIGIN** by
placing the **ORIGIN** of a specified **UNIT** in the **ARRAY** at a
specified location in the **UNIT**.

To create a geometry mockup from a physical configuration, the user
should keep the restrictions mentioned earlier in mind. There may be
several ways of correctly describing the same physical configuration.
Careful analysis of the system can result in a simpler mockup and
shorter computer running time. A mockup with fewer geometry regions may
run faster than the same mockup with extraneous regions. The number of
**UNIT**\ s used can affect the running time, because a transformation
of coordinates must be made every time a history moves from one **UNIT**
into another. Thus, if the size of a **UNIT** is small relative to the
mean free path, a larger percentage of time is spent processing the
transformation of coordinates. Because all boundaries in a **UNIT** must
be checked for crossings, it may be more efficient to break up complex
**UNIT**\ s into several smaller, simpler **UNIT**\ s. The trade-off
involves the time required to process more boundary crossings vs the
time required to transform coordinate systems when **UNIT** boundaries
are crossed.

**Geometry dimensions:** The use of FIDO syntax may help simplify the
description of the geometry. For example, a 20 × 20 × 2.5 cm rectangular
parallelepiped would have been described as **CUBOID** 1 1 10.0 −10.0
10.0 −10.0 1.25 −1.25 in KENO V.a and **CUBOID** 1 10.0 –10.0 10.0 –10.0
1.25 –1.25 in KENO-VI. By using the P option (see Table 8.1.17), the
same rectangular parallelepiped could be described as **CUBOID** 1 1
4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO V.a and or **CUBOID** 1 4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO-VI,
where the last 6 entries describe the geometry. The P option simply
repeats the dimension following the P for the number of times stated
before the P, and it reverses the sign every time. Therefore, 6P8.0 is
equivalent to 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0.

**Geometry comments:** One comment can be entered for each **UNIT** in
the *geometry region data*. Similarly, one comment can be entered for
each **ARRAY** in the *array definition data*. A comment can be entered
using the keyword **COM**\ =. This is followed by a comment with a
maximum length of 132 characters. The comment must be preceded and
terminated by a delimiter character. Acceptable delimiters include “ , ‘
, \* , ^ , or !. One comment is allowed for each **UNIT** in the
*geometry region data*. If multiple comments are entered for a **UNIT**,
the last comment is used. The comment can be entered anywhere after the
**UNIT** number where a keyword is expected (:ref:`8-1-2-4`). See the
following example.

Some of the basics of KENO geometry are illustrated in the following examples:

EXAMPLE 1. Assume a stack of six cylindrical disks each measuring 5 cm
in radius and 2 cm thick. The bottom disk is composed of material 1, and
the next disk is composed of material 2, etc., alternating throughout
the stack. A square plate of material 3 that is 20 cm on a side and
2.5 cm thick is centered on top of the stack. This configuration is
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-12`.

.. _fig8-1-12:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig12.png
  :align: center
  :width: 400

  Stack of disks with a square top.

This problem can be described as a single **UNIT** problem, describing
the cylindrical portion first. In this instance, the origin has been
chosen at the center bottom of the bottom disk. The bottom disk is
defined by the first cylinder description, and the next disk is defined
by the difference between the first and second cylinder descriptions.
Since both disks have a radius of 5.0 and a −Z length of 0.0, the first
cylinder containing material 1 exists from Z = 0.0 to Z = 2.0, and the
second cylinder containing material 2 exists from Z = 2.0 to Z = 4.0.
When all the disks have been described, a void cuboid having the same X
and Y dimensions as the square plate and the same Z dimensions as the
stack of disks is defined. The square plate of material 3 is then
defined on top of the stack. Omission of the first cuboid description
would result in the stack of disks being encased in a solid cuboid of
material 3 instead of having a flat plate on top of the stack. The
geometry input is shown below.

An alternative description of the same example is given below. The
origin has been chosen at the center of the disk of material 1 nearest
the center of the stack. This disk of material 1 is defined by the first
cylinder description, and the disks of material 2 on either side of it
are defined by the second cylinder description. The top and bottom disks
of material 1 are defined by the third cylinder, and the top disk of
material 2 is defined by the last cylinder. The square plate is defined
by the two cuboids. This description is more efficient than the previous
one because there are fewer surfaces to check for crossings.

Example 1 can also be described as an **ARRAY**. Define three different
**UNIT** types. **UNIT** 1 will define a disk of material 1, **UNIT** 2
will define a disk of material 2, and **UNIT** 3 will define the square
plate of material 3. The origin of each **UNIT** is defined at the
center bottom of the disk or plate being described. As mentioned
earlier, only **UNIT**\ s with a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as their outer
boundary can be placed in a cuboidal **ARRAY**. The geometry input for
this arrangement is shown below.

Be aware that each **UNIT** in a geometry description can have its
origin defined independent of the other **UNIT**\ s. It would be correct
to use **UNIT**\ s 1 and 3 from data descriptions 3, and **UNIT** 2 from
data description 4. The *array data* would remain the same as data
description 3, Example 1. The user should define the origin of each unit
to be as convenient as possible for the chosen description. Care should
be taken when assigning coordinates to the **UNIT** used to **PLACE**
the **ARRAY** in its surrounding region.

Another method of describing Example 1 as a bare array is to define
**UNIT** 1 to be a disk of material 1 topped by a disk of material 2.
The origin has been chosen at the center bottom of the disk of
material 1. **UNIT** 2 is the square plate of material 3 with the origin
at the center of the **UNIT**. The **ARRAY** consists of three
**UNIT** 1s, topped by a **UNIT** 2, as shown below.

Example 1 can be described as a reflected **ARRAY** by treating the
square plate as a reflector in the positive Z direction. One means of
describing this situation is to define **UNIT**\ s 1 and 2 as in data
description 3, Example 1. The origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT** is defined
to be at the center of the **ARRAY**. The corresponding input geometry
is shown below.

The user could have chosen the origin of the **ARRAY** boundary to be at

description for the **GLOBAL UNIT** would be:

The reflector region at the top of the array can be added by using a
**CUBOID** or by using a **REPLICATE** description in KENO V.a. Recall
that there is no **REPLICATE** function in KENO-VI.

A simpler method of describing Example 1 as a reflected array is to
define only one unit as in data description 5, Example 1. The square
plate is treated as a reflector, as in data description 6, Example 1.

EXAMPLE 2. Assume that the stack of six disks in Example 1 is placed at
the center bottom of a cylindrical container composed of material 6
whose inside diameter is 16.0 cm. The bottom and sides of the container
are 0.25 cm thick, the top is open, and the total height of the
container is 18.25 cm. Assume the square plate of Example 1 is centered
on top of the container.

In the above description, the origin is defined to be at the center of
the disk of material 1 nearest the center of the stack. This disk is
defined by the first cylinder description. The disks of material 2 above
and below it are defined by the second cylinder description. The disks
of material 1 above and below them are defined by the third cylinder
description. The top disk of material 2 is defined by the fourth
cylinder description. The void interior of the container is defined by
the fifth cylinder description. The container is defined by the last
cylinder description. The first cuboid description is used to define a
void whose X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate and whose
Z dimensions are the same as the container. The last cuboid description
defines the square plate. Omission of the first cuboid description would
result in the container being encased in a solid cuboid of material 3.
Thus, both cuboids are necessary to properly define the square plate.

Example 2 can be described as a reflected **ARRAY**. One of the
descriptions uses only one **UNIT** and is similar to data
description 7, Example 1. This description is shown below.

In the above data description, the first two cylinder descriptions
define a disk of material 1 with a disk of material 2 directly on top of
it. A tight fitting void cuboid is placed around them so they can be
stacked three high to achieve the stack of disks shown in Example 1,
:numref:`fig8-1-12`. This array comprises the array portion of the geometry
region description. The origin of the array boundary, a tight fitting
cube or cuboid that encompasses the array, is defined by the **ARRAY**
description. Everything after the **ARRAY** record is considered part of
the reflector. The first cylinder after the **ARRAY** record defines the
void interior of the cylindrical container. The next cylinder defines
the walls of the container. The second-to-last cuboid defines a void
volume outside the container from its bottom to its top and having the
same X and Y dimensions as the square plate. The last cuboid defines the
square plate of material 3 that is sitting on top of the container.

Another method to describe Example 2 is as an array composed of units
that contain both the stack and container. This description requires a
minimum of four units to describe the problem. This configuration is
given below in data description 3, Example 2.

In the above description, **UNIT** 1 is the bottom of the cylindrical
container. The void **CUBOID** is only as tall as the bottom of the
container, and its X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate
on top of the container. If all the **UNIT**\ s in the **ARRAY** use
these same dimensions in the X and Y directions, the requirement that
adjacent faces of units in contact with each other must be the same size
and shape is satisfied. This **ARRAY** is stacked in the Z direction, so
all **UNIT**\ s must have the same overall dimensions in the X direction
and in the Y direction. **UNIT** 2 will be used in the **ARRAY** three
times to create the stack of disks. It contains a disk of material 1
topped by a disk of material 2. The portion of the container that
contains the disks and the cuboid that defines the outer boundaries of
the unit are included in **UNIT** 2. **UNIT** 3 describes the empty top
portion of the container and the square plate on top of it. The
Z dimensions of **UNIT** 3 were determined by subtracting three times
the total Z dimension of **UNIT** 2 from the inside height of the
container [18.0 − (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. This can also be determined from the
overall height of the container by subtracting off the bottom thickness
of the container and three times the height of **UNIT** 2 [18.25 − 0.25
− (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. The origin of **UNIT** 3 is located at the center of
this distance. For the KENO-VI input, a **GLOBAL UNIT** is also
provided, **UNIT** 4, containing the **ARRAY** built with **UNIT**\ s 1,
2, 3.

EXAMPLE 3. Refer to Example 1, :numref:`fig8-1-12`, and imagine a **HOLE**
1.5 cm in diameter is drilled along the centerline of the stack through
the disks and the square plate. In KENO V.a this **HOLE** would
eliminate the possibility of describing the system as a single unit
because the **HOLE** in the center of the alternating materials of the
stack cannot be described in a manner that allows each successive
geometry region to encompass the regions interior to it. Therefore, it
must be described as an **ARRAY**. The square plate on the top of the
disks is defined as a **UNIT** in the **ARRAY**. In the geometry
description given below, the square plate is defined in **UNIT** 3.
KENO-VI can easily describe this configuration as a single **UNIT**.

In data description 1, Example 3 above, KENO V.a input, **UNIT** 1
describes a disk of material 1 with a **HOLE** through its centerline.
The first **CYLINDER** defines the **HOLE**, the second defines the rest
of the disk, and the **CUBOID** defines the size of the **UNIT** to be
consistent with the square plate so they can be stacked together in an
**ARRAY**. **UNIT** 2 describes a disk of material 2 in similar fashion.
**UNIT** 3 describes the square plate of material 3 with a **HOLE**
through its center. The **CYLINDER** defines the **HOLE** and the
**CUBOID** defines the square plate. These three **UNIT**\ s are stacked
in the Z direction to achieve the composite system. This is represented
by **FILL** 1 2 2Q2 3. The 2Q2 repeats the two entries preceding the 2Q2
twice. Alternatively, this can be achieved by entering **FILL** 1 2 1 2
1 2 3 **END FILL**. The same **ARRAY** can also be achieved using the
**LOOP** option. An example of the data for this option is:

**LOOP** 1 6R1 1 5 2 2 6R1 2 6 2 3 6R1 7 7 1 **END LOOP**.

**UNIT** 1 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, and Z = 1,3,5 positions of the
**ARRAY** by entering 1 6R1 1 5 2. **UNIT** 2 is positioned at the X =
1, Y = 1 and Z = 2,4,6 positions in the **ARRAY** by entering 2 6R1 2 6
2. **UNIT** 3 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 7 position of the
**ARRAY** by entering 3 6R1 7 7 1. See Sect. 8.1.2.5 for additional
information regarding **ARRAY** specifications.

For the KENO-VI input, **UNIT** 1 contains the entire problem
description. The first **CYLINDER** describes the 1.5 cm diameter hole
through the stack. The next four **CYLINDER**\ s define the stack. The
sixth and seventh **CYLINDER**\ s describe the void and container. The
two **CUBOID**\ s describe the top plate and surrounding global region
of void. The **MEDIA** cards are used to place the materials in the
appropriate regions.

EXAMPLE 4. Assume two large cylinders that are 2.5 cm in radius and 5 cm
long are connected by a smaller cylinder that is 0.5 cm in radius and
10 cm long, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-13`. All three cylinders are composed of
material 1. By starting the geometry description in the small cylinder,
this system can be described as a single unit.

The origin is at the center of the small cylinder, which is described by
the first cylinder description. The second cylinder description defines
a void cylinder surrounding the small cylinder. Its radius is the same
as the large cylinders, and its height (length) coincides with that of
the small cylinder. The last cylinder description defines the large
cylinders on either end of the small cylinder. In KENO V.a, because this
problem does not specify otherwise, the length of the **CYLINDER**\ s is
assumed to coincide with the Z axis. In KENO-VI, because the problem was
created using **XCYLINDER**\ s, the long axes of the **CYLINDER**\ s
coincide with the X axis.

EXAMPLE 5. Assume two large cylinders with a center-to-center spacing of
15 cm, each having a radius of 2.5 cm and length of 5 cm, are connected
radially by a small cylinder having a radius of 1.5 cm, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-14`.

  Two large cylinders radially connected by a small cylinder.

This system cannot be described rigorously in KENO V.a geometry because
the intersection of the cylinders cannot be described. However, it can
be approximated two ways, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-15`. The top approximation
is described in data description 1, Example 5. The bottom approximation
is described in data description 2, Example 5, and data description 3,
Example 5. These may be poor approximations for criticality safety
calculations.

The above geometry description uses **ARRAY**\ s of **ARRAY**\ s (see
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3`) to describe the bottom approximation of :numref:`fig8-1-15`.
**UNIT** 1 defines a large **CYLINDER** that has a radius of 2.5 cm and
a height of 10 cm inside a close-fitting **CUBOID**. This is used in
both large **CYLINDER**\ s as the portion of the large **CYLINDER** that
exists above and below the region where the small **CYLINDER** joins it.
**UNIT** 5 is the spacing between the tops of the two large
**CYLINDER**\ s and the spacing between the bottoms of the two large
**CYLINDER**\ s. **ARRAY** 1 thus defines the bottom of the system:
two short **CYLINDER**\ s (**UNIT** 1s) separated by 10 cm (**UNIT** 5
is the separation). **UNIT** 6 contains **ARRAY** 1.

**UNIT** 2 is the left hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal
**CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 3 is the right hemicylinder that adjoins the
horizontal **CYLINDER**. **UNIT** 4 defines the horizontal **CYLINDER**.
**ARRAY** 2 contains **UNIT**\ s 2, 4, and 3 from left to right. This
defines the central portion of the system where the horizontal
**CYLINDER** adjoins the two hemicylinders. These hemicylinders are
larger than half **CYLINDER**\ s. **UNIT** 7 contains **ARRAY** 2. The
entire system is achieved by stacking a **UNIT** 6 above and below the
**UNIT** 7 as defined in **ARRAY** 3, the **GLOBAL ARRAY**.

The above geometry description uses **HOLE**\ s (see :ref:`8-1-3-6-1`) to
describe the bottom approximation of :numref:`fig8-1-15`. **UNIT** 1 defines a
large **CYLINDER** with a radius of 2.5 cm and a height of 1.0 cm.
**UNIT** 2 defines the same **CYLINDER** within a **CUBOID** that
extends from X = −2.5 to X = 17.5, from Y = −2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0
to Z = 1.0. The origin of the **CYLINDER** is at (0.0,0.0,0.0). Thus
**UNIT** 2 describes the top and bottom of the **CYLINDER** on the left.
**UNIT** 1 is positioned within this **CUBOID** as a **HOLE** with its
origin at (15.0,0.0,0.0) to describe the top and bottom of the
**CYLINDER** on the right. **UNIT** 3 is the left hemicylinder that
adjoins the horizontal **CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 4 is the right
hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal **CYLINDER**. **UNIT** 5
defines the horizontal **CYLINDER** with its origin at the center within
a **CUBOID** that extends from X = −10.0 to X = +10.0, Y = −2.5 to Y =
2.5, and Z = −1.5 to Z = 1.5. **UNIT** 3 is positioned to the left of
the horizontal **CYLINDER**, and **UNIT** 4 is positioned to the right
of the horizontal **CYLINDER** by using **HOLE**\ s. The entire system
is achieved by stacking a **UNIT** 2 above and below **UNIT** 5 as shown
in the **ARRAY** data.

This same geometry description can be used with **UNIT** 2 redefined,
having its origin defined so that it extends from X = −10 to X = 10, Y =
−2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0 to Z = 1. In this instance, the geometry
data would be identical except for **UNIT** 2. This alternative
description of **UNIT** 2 is

The first and second **CYLINDER**\ s define the two large

  Two small cylinders joined axially by a large cylinder.

This problem is very similar to Example 4. It can be described as a
single **UNIT** in KENO-VI, but not in KENO V.a where it must be
described as an array. In KENO V.a, **UNIT** 1 defines the large
cylinder, and **UNIT** 2 defines the small cylinder. The origin of each
**UNIT** is at its center. The composite system consists of two
**UNIT** 2s and one **UNIT** 1 as shown below. In KENO-VI,
**CYLINDER** 1 defines the long thin cylinder, and **CYLINDER** 2
defines the short thick cylinder. The origin of each cylinder is at its
center. In both KENO V.a and KENO-VI, the centerline of the cylinders
lies along the Z axis.

In the KENO V.a input, the **ARRAY** boundary defines the origin of the
**REFLECTOR** to be at the center of the **ARRAY**. The 6*3.0 in the
**REFLECTOR** description repeats the 3.0 six times. The **REFLECTOR**
record is used to generate ten **REFLECTOR** regions, each of which is
3.0 cm thick, on all six faces of the **ARRAY**.

In the KENO-VI input, the basic **UNIT** used to construct the **ARRAY**
is defined in **UNIT** 1. The **ARRAY** is positioned in **UNIT** 2
(the **GLOBAL UNIT**) using the **ARRAY** card and the **PLACE** option.
The **ARRAY** is then surrounded by ten \ **REFLECTOR** regions, each
3.0 cm thick, on all sides.

The first bias **ID** is 2, so the last bias **ID** will be 11 if
10 regions are created. The biasing data block is necessary to apply
the desired weighting or biasing function to the reflector. The
biasing material ID is obtained from :numref:`tab8-1-20`. IDs, group
structure and incremental thickness for
weighting data available on the KENO  weighting library. If the
biasing data block is omitted from the problem description, the 10
reflector regions will not have a biasing function applied to them,
and the default value of the average weight will be used. This may
cause the problem to execute more slowly, and therefore require the
use of more computer time.

EXAMPLE 10. Assume the reflector in Example 9 is present only on both
X faces, both Y faces, and the negative Z face. The reflector is only
15.24 cm thick on these faces. The top of the array (positive Z face) is
unreflected.

In the KENO V.a input, the first **REFLECTOR** description generates
five regions around the **ARRAY**, each region being 3.0 cm thick in the
+X, −X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. This defines a total thickness of 15 cm of reflector
material on the appropriate faces. The second **REFLECTOR** description
generates the last 0.24 cm of material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total
reflector thickness is 15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the
top which has no reflector. Five reflector regions were generated by the
first **REFLECTOR** description, and one was generated by the second
**REFLECTOR** description; so, six biasing regions must be defined in
the biasing data. Thus, the beginning bias **ID** is 2, and the ending
bias ID is 7.

In the KENO-VI input, the first **CUBOID** in Unit 2 represents the
boundary for the **ARRAY**. The next four **CUBOID**\ s represent the
first four regions around the **ARRAY**, each region being 3.0 cm thick
in the +X, X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. A total thickness of 12 cm of reflector material is on the
appropriate faces. The last **CUBOID** represents the last 3.24 cm of
material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total reflector thickness is
15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the top which has no
reflector. The beginning bias ID is 2, and the ending bias ID is 6. The
last region could either be larger or smaller than the recommended
thickness to complete the reflector.

The biasing material **ID** and thickness per region are obtained from
:numref:`tab8-1-20`. The thickness per region should be very nearly the
thickness per region from the table to avoid over biasing in the
reflector. Partial increments at the outer region of a reflector are
exempt from this recommendation. If a biasing function is not to be
applied to a region generated by the **REFLECTOR** record, the thickness
per region can be any desired thickness and the biasing data block is
omitted.

EXAMPLE 11. Assume the array of Example 7 has the central unit of the
array replaced by a cylinder of material 4, 5 cm in radius and 10 cm
tall. Assume a 20 cm thick spherical reflector of material 3 (concrete)
is positioned so its inner radius is 65 cm from the center of the array.
The minimum inner radius of a spherical reflector for this array is
62.25 cm (:math:`\sqrt{55^{2} + 25^{2} + 15^{2} }`). If the inner radius is smaller than this, the problem
cannot be described using KENO V.a geometry.

**UNIT** 1 describes the **SPHERE** and spacing used in the **ARRAY**.
**UNIT** 2 defines the **CYLINDER** located at the center of the
**ARRAY**. In KENO V.a, the **ARRAY** record defines the origin of the
reflector to be at the center of the **ARRAY**, while in KENO-VI it
defines the origin of the **ARRAY** to be at the center of the **GLOBAL
UNIT**. The first **SPHERE** in the **GLOBAL UNIT** defines the inner
radius of the reflector. The next four **SPHERE** and four **MEDIA**
records of the KENO-VI input and the **REPLICATE** record of the KENO
V.a input will generate four spherical regions of material 3, each
5.0 cm thick. The data for the **BIAS** block is generated in a similar
manner to previous examples, except that concrete (ID=301) is used. The
recommended reflector thickness is 5 cm; this thickness is incorporated
explicitly in the KENO-VI model and with 4 repetitions of the 5 cm thick
reflector via **REPLICATE** in the KENO V.a model. The first 10 entries
following the word **LOOP** fills the 11 × 5 × 3 **ARRAY** with
**UNIT**\ s 1. The next 10 entries position **UNIT** 2 at the center of
the **ARRAY** (X = 6, Y = 3, and Z = 2), replacing the **UNIT** 1 that
had been placed there by the first 10 entries.

EXAMPLE 12. Assume a data profile such as fission densities is desired
in a cylinder at 0.5 cm intervals in the radial direction and 1.5 cm
intervals axially. The cylinder is composed of material 1 and has a
radius of 5 cm and a height of 15 cm. The **REPLICATE** or **REFLECTOR**
description can be used to generate these regions in KENO V.a. A biasing
data block is not entered because default biasing is desired throughout
the cylinder.

Use of holes in the geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`8-1-3-6` tells how each KENO V.a geometry region in a **UNIT**
must completely enclose all previously described regions in that
**UNIT** and how KENO-VI geometry allows regions in a **UNIT** to
intersect, thus eliminating the need for **HOLE**\ s. **HOLE**\ s can be
used to circumvent the complete enclosure restriction in KENO V.a to
some degree. In KENO-VI, they can be useful in simplifying the input of
a problem and decreasing the total CPU time needed for a problem.
A \ **HOLE** is a means of placing an entire **UNIT** within a geometry
region. A separate **HOLE** description is required for every location
in a geometry region where a **UNIT** is to be placed. The information
contained in a **HOLE** description is (1) the keyword **HOLE**, (2) the
**UNIT** number of the **UNIT** to be placed, and (3) any modification
data needed to correctly position and rotate (in KENO-VI) the specified
**UNIT** within the containing **UNIT**. In KENO V.a, a **HOLE** is
placed inside the geometry region that precedes it. This excludes
**HOLE**\ s ... (i.e., if a **CUBE** geometry region is followed by four
**HOLE** descriptions, all four **HOLE**\ s are located within the
**CUBE**). In KENO V.a, **HOLE**\ s are subject to the restriction that
they cannot intersect any other geometry region. **HOLE**\ s can be
nested to any depth (see :ref:`8-1-3-6-2`). It is not advisable to use
**HOLE**\ s tangent to other **HOLE**\ s or geometry, because round-off
error may cause them to overlap. It is not uncommon for a problem that
runs on one type of computer to fail on another type using the same
data. Therefore, it is recommended that tangency and boundaries shared
with **HOLE**\ s be avoided. This may be accomplished by separating the
otherwise collocated or tangent surfaces by a very small (i.e.,
10\ :sup:`-6` cm) distance.

In KENO V.a, tracking in regions that contain holes is less efficient
than tracking in regions that do not contain holes. Therefore, holes
should be used only when the system cannot be easily described by
conventional methods. One example of the use of holes is shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-19`, representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus.

In KENO-VI, tracking in regions that contain **HOLE**\ s can be more
efficient than tracking in regions that do not contain **HOLE**\ s
because every region boundary in a **UNIT** must be checked for a
crossing whenever a crossing is possible. Putting small but complex
geometries in a hole will lessen the number of boundaries that need to
be checked for possible crossings. However, the indiscriminate use of
holes is not advised since the particle must change coordinate systems
every time a hole is entered or exited. Therefore, holes should be used
carefully and only when the system can be simplified significantly by
their use.

EXAMPLE 15. One example of a unit that requires holes in KENO V.a is
better described not using holes in KENO-VI as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-19`,
representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus. The large rods are
1.4 cm in radius and composed of mixture 3. The small rods are 0.6 cm
in radius and composed of mixture 1. The inside radius of the annulus
is 3.6 cm, and the outside radius is 3.8 cm. The annulus is made of
mixture 2. The rods and annulus are both 30 cm long. The annulus is
centered in a cuboid having an 8 cm\ :sup:`2` cross section and a
length of 32 cm. The black and gray areas in
:numref:`fig8-1-19` are void.

The first **HOLE** description in the KENO V.a input represents the
bottom large rod. It takes **UNIT** 2 and places its **ORIGIN** at
(0.0,−2.0,0.0) relative to the **ORIGIN** of **UNIT** 3. The second
**HOLE** description represents the small rod to the right of the large
rod just discussed. It places the origin of **UNIT** 1 at (2.0,−2.0,0.0)
in **UNIT** 3. The third **HOLE** description represents the large rod
to the right. It places the origin of **UNIT** 2 at (2.0,0.0,0.0) in
**UNIT** 3. This procedure is repeated in a counterclockwise direction
until all eight rods have been placed within the region that defines the
inner surface of the annulus. The **CYLINDER** that defines the outer
surface of the annulus is described after all the **HOLE**\ s for the
previous region have been placed. Then the outer **CUBOID** is
described. This example illustrates that a **UNIT** that is to be placed
using a **HOLE** description need not have a **CUBE** or **CUBOID** as
its last region. Note that including the central rod directly in
**UNIT** 3 reduces the CPU time required for transport compared to the
case of all 9 rods being inserted as **HOLE**\ s. It is also important
that the 9 **HOLE**\ s are inserted *after* the void cylinder into which
they are inserted. Entering the **HOLE**\ s in any other position in the
input would generated region intersection errors. The order of the HOLE
records in any given region is not important, as they can be
interchanged with each other randomly. However, they must always appear
immediately after the region in which they are placed.

The KENO-VI input does not need to use **HOLE**\ s. The first
**CYLINDER** description in this case represents the middle small rod.
The next four **CYLINDER** records describe the four remaining small
rods surrounding the middle rod. The **ORIGIN** attribute is used to
shift the origin of each **CYLINDER** to the appropriate location. The
following four **CYLINDER** records represent the four large rods.
Again, the **ORIGIN** attribute is used to shift the **ORIGIN** of each
**CYLINDER** to the appropriate location. Only the nonzero dimensions
need to be entered in the **ORIGIN** data. The tenth **CYLINDER** record
is the void in the annulus that contains the rods. The last **CYLINDER**
record defines the outer surface of the annulus. Finally, the **CUBOID**
record describes the surrounding **UNIT** boundary.


In KENO-VI, holes may not extend across any array outer boundary, may
not intersect with other holes, and may not cross the host UNIT outer
boundary. Thus a hole may be placed so that it crosses several regions
within an array. The hole description replaces the unit description
within the hole domain. Since the holes are placed using the host UNIT
coordinate system, the location of the hole record in the unit
definition is not relevant.

An array of the arrangement shown in :numref:`fig8-1-19` can be easily described
by altering the array description data. For example, a 5 × 3 × 2 array
of these shapes with a center-to-center spacing of 8 cm in X and Y and
32 cm in Z can be achieved by using the following array data:

::

	READ ARRAY  NUX=5 NUY=3 NUZ=2  FILL F3  END FILL  END ARRAY

or

::

	READ ARRAY  NUX=5 NUY=3 NUZ=2  FILL 30*3  END FILL  END ARRAY

Nesting holes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section illustrates how holes are nested. Holes can be nested to
any level. Consider the configuration illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-19` and
replace the large rods with a complicated geometric arrangement. The
resulting Fig. is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-20`. :numref:`fig8-1-21` shows the
complicated geometric arrangement that replaced the large rods of
:numref:`fig8-1-19`. :numref:`fig8-1-22` shows a component of the arrangement shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-20`.

EXAMPLE 16. There is no predetermined preferred method to create a
geometry mockup for a given physical system. The user should determine
the most convenient order. To describe the configuration shown in Fig.
8.1.20 using nested **HOLE**\ s, it is likely most convenient to start
the geometry mockup at the deepest nesting level, as shown in
Fig. 8.1.22. The small **CYLINDER**\ s are composed of mixture 1, and
they are each 0.1 cm in radius and 30 cm long. There are five small
**CYLINDER**\ s used in Fig. 8.1.22. Their centers are located at
(0,0,0) for the central one, at (0,−0.4,0) for the bottom one, at
(0.4,0,0) for the right one, at (0,0.4,0) for the top one, and at
(−0.4,0,0) for the left one. The rectangular parallelepipeds
(**CUBOID**\ s) are composed of mixture 2. Each one is 30 cm long and
0.1 cm by 0.2 cm in cross section. The large **CYLINDER** containing the
configuration is composed of mixture 3, is 30 cm long and has a radius
of 0.5 cm.

A possible geometry mockup for this system is described as follows in
KENO V.a:

   (1) define a small cylinder to be **UNIT** 1,

   (2) define a small **CUBOID** with its length in the X direction to
   be **UNIT** 2,

   (3) define a small **CUBOID** with its length in the Y direction to
   be **UNIT** 3,

   (4) define **UNIT** 4 to be the large cylinder and place the
   **CYLINDER**\ s and **CUBOID**\ s in it using **HOLE**\ s.

In :numref:`fig8-1-21`, the large plain cylinders are composed of mixture 1 and
are 0.5 cm in radius and 30 cm long. The cylindrical component of
**UNIT** 4 for KENO V.a or **UNIT** 1 for KENO-VI is the same size: an
outer radius of 0.5 cm and a length of 30 cm. The small cylinders
located in the interstices between the large cylinders are composed of
mixture 2, are 0.2 cm in radius, and are 30 cm long. The annulus is
composed of mixture 4, has a 1.3 cm inside radius and a 1.4 cm outer
radius. The volume between the inner cylinders is void. The large
cylinders each have a radius of 0.5 cm and are tangent. Therefore, their
origins are offset from the origin of the **UNIT** by 0.707107. This is
from X\ :sup:`2` + Y\ :sup:`2` = 1.0, where X and Y are equal.

For KENO V.a, define **UNIT** 5 to be the large plain cylinder,
**UNIT** 6 to be the small cylinder, and **UNIT** 7 as the annulus that
contains the cylinders. Its origin is at its center. The geometry mockup
for this portion of the problem follows:

Multiple arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EXAMPLE 17. :ref:`8-1-3-6` demonstrates how **UNIT**\ s are composed of
geometry regions and how these **UNIT**\ s can be stacked in an
**ARRAY**. This same procedure can be extended to create multiple
**ARRAY**\ s. Furthermore, **ARRAY**\ s can be used as building blocks
within other **ARRAY**\ s.

Consider Sample Problem 19 from Appendix C. This problem is a critical
experiment consisting of a composite array :cite:`thomas_critical_1973,thomas_critical_1964` of four
highly enriched uranium metal cylinders and four cylindrical Plexiglas
containers filled with uranyl nitrate solution. A photograph of the
experiment is given in :numref:`fig9-1c-3`. The coordinate system is defined to
be Z up the page, Y across the page, and X out of the page.

The Plexiglas containers have an inside radius of 9.525 cm and an
outside radius of 10.16 cm. The inside height is 17.78 cm, and the
outside height is 19.05 cm. Four of these containers are stacked with a
center-to-center spacing of 21.75 cm in the Y direction and 20.48 cm in
the Z direction (vertical). This arrangement of four Plexiglas
containers can be described as follows: mixture 2 is the uranyl nitrate
and mixture 3 is Plexiglas, so the Plexiglas container with its
appropriate spacing **CUBOID** can be described as **UNIT** 1. This
considers the **ARRAY** to be bare and suspended with no supports.

  BOUNDARY  3

The **ARRAY** of four Plexiglas containers can be described as
**ARRAY** 1 in the array data as follows:

   **ARA**\ =1 **NUX**\ =1 **NUY**\ =2 **NUZ**\ =2 **FILL** F1 **END
   FILL**

The four metal cylinders, comprised of mixture 1, each have a radius of
5.748 cm and are 10.765 cm tall. They have a center-to-center spacing of
13.18 cm in the Y direction and 12.45 cm in the Z direction (vertical).
Thus, one of the metal cylinders with its appropriate spacing **CUBOID**
can be described as **UNIT** 2. This **ARRAY** is also considered to be
bare and unsupported.

Now two **ARRAY**\ s have been described. The overall dimensions of the
**ARRAY** of Plexiglas containers are 21.75 cm in X, 43.5 cm in Y, and
40.96 cm in Z. The overall dimensions of the **ARRAY** of metal
cylinders are 13.18 cm in X, 26.36 cm in Y, and 24.9 cm in Z.

In order to describe the composite **ARRAY**, these two **ARRAY**\ s
must be positioned within **UNIT**\ s and stacked together into one
**ARRAY**. In order for them to be stacked into one **ARRAY**, the
adjacent faces must match. This is accomplished by defining a **UNIT** 3
which contains **ARRAY** 1, the **ARRAY** of Plexiglas solution
containers. The overall dimensions of this **UNIT** are 21.75 cm in X,
43.5 cm in Y, and 40.96 cm in Z. These dimensions are calculated by the
code and need not be specified. **UNIT** 3 is defined as follows:

KENO V.a:

::

  UNIT 3
  ARRAY 1  3*0.0

KENO-VI:

::

  UNIT 3
  CUBOID  1 2P10.875 2P21.75 2P20.48
  ARRAY 1 1 PLACE 1 1 1 0.0 -10.875 -10.24
  BOUNDARY  1

The **ARRAY** of metal cylinders will be defined to be **UNIT** 4.
However, this **ARRAY** is 17.14 cm smaller in the Y and 16.06 cm
smaller in the Z dimensions than the **ARRAY** of Plexiglas **UNIT**\ s.
Therefore, a void region must be placed around the **ARRAY** in those
directions so **UNIT** 4 and **UNIT** 3 will be the same size in Y and
Z.

KENO V.a:

::

  UNIT 4
  ARRAY  2  3*0.0
  REPLICATE  0 1 2*0.0  2*8.57  2*8.03  1

  ARRAY  2  1 PLACE 1 1 1 0.0 -6.59 -6.225
  MEDIA 0 1 2 -1
  BOUNDARY 2

Now that **UNIT** 3 and **UNIT** 4 have been defined, they must be
placed in the global or universe **ARRAY** to define the physical
arrangement of the eight pieces. This procedure is implemented via a
**GLOBAL** **ARRAY** in KENO V.a, while KENO-VI uses a **GLOBAL UNIT** 3
as follows:


KENO V.a:

The description of **ARRAY** 3 in KENO-VI is identical to that shown for
KENO V.a.

This completes the geometry description for the problem. The complete

EXAMPLE 18. Consider a storage array of highly enriched uranium buttons,
each 1 in. tall and 4 in. in diameter. These buttons are stored on
stainless steel shelves with a center-to-center spacing of 60.96 cm
(2 ft) between them in the Y direction, and only one button on each
shelf in the X direction. The shelves are 0.635 cm
(:sup:`1`/:sub:`4` in.) thick (Z dimension), 45.72 cm (18 in.) wide (X
dimension), 609.6 cm (20 ft) long (Y dimension), and are 45.72 cm
(18 in.) from the top of a shelf to the bottom of the shelf above it.
Each rack of storage shelves is four shelves high, with the first shelf
being 15.24 cm (6 in.) above the floor. The storage room is 586.56 cm
(19.5 ft) in the X direction by 1293.44 cm (43 ft) in the Y direction
with 365.76 cm (12 ft. ) ceilings in the Z direction. The walls,
ceiling, and floor are composed of concrete, 30.48 cm (1 ft) thick. All
the aisles between the storage racks are 91.44 cm (3 ft) wide. The racks
are arranged with their length in the Y direction and an aisle between
them. The arrays of racks are arranged with two in the Y direction and
five in the X direction. Mixture 1 is the uranium metal, mixture 2 is
the stainless steel, and mixture 3 is the concrete.

The metal button and its center-to-center spacing are described first.
The void vertical spacing has arbitrarily been chosen to extend from the
bottom of the button to the next shelf above the button. The shelf of
stainless steel is described under the button.

  Entire storage array in the room.

The complete input for this room is given below: The plots for this
problem must be quite large in order to see all the detail because the
array is sparse and the shelves are thin. Therefore, the plots for this
system are not included as Fig.s. The user can generate the plots if it
is desirable to see them. The nuclide IDs used in this problem are for
the 16-group Hansen-Roach working format library, which is no longer
distributed with SCALE.

Arrays and holes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`8-1-3-6-1` and :ref:`8-1-3-6-2` describe the use of **HOLE**\ s, and
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3` describes multiple **ARRAY**\ s and **ARRAY**\ s of
**ARRAY**\ s. **HOLE**\ s can be used to place **ARRAY**\ s at locations
in other **UNIT**\ s. This section contains examples to illustrate the
combined use of **ARRAY**\ s and **HOLE**\ s.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 19. A SIMPLE CASK


This example consists of cylindrical mild steel container with an inside
radius of 4.15 cm and a radial wall thickness of 0.45 cm. The thickness
of the ends of the container is 1.27 cm, and the inside height is
10.1 cm. Highly enriched uranium rods 1 cm in diameter and 10 cm long
are banded together into square bundles of four. These bundles are then
positioned in the mild steel container as shown in Fig. 8.1.28. The rods
sit on the floor of the container and have a 0.1 cm gap between their
tops and the top of the container.

To generate the geometry description for this system, **UNIT** 1 is
defined as one uranium rod and its associated square-pitch close-packed
spacing region.

four bundles of rods.

**ARRAY** 2 is defined to be a bundle of four rods.

   FILL**

**ARRAY** 2 is placed in **UNIT** 2. This defines the outer boundaries
of an imaginary **CUBOID** that contains the **ARRAY**. It is convenient
to have the origin of the **ARRAY** at its center, so the most negative
point of the array will be (−1, −1,−5).

  UNIT 2
  ARRAY 2  -1.0 -1.0 -5.0

An **ARRAY** record is used to place **ARRAY** 1 in the **GLOBAL UNIT**.
Then the cylindrical container is described around it and **HOLE**\ s
are used to place the four outer bundles around the central **ARRAY**.

**ARRAY** 1 is placed in **UNIT** 3. The first **CYLINDER** card defines
the **ARRAY** **BOUNDARY**. Everything external to this boundary is not
considered part of the problem. The positions in the **ARRAY** that do
not contain rods are filled with cuboids consisting of void. The
**ARRAY** boundary must either coincide with the outer boundary of the
**ARRAY** or be contained within the **ARRAY**. An exterior void region
is placed around the array boundary to coincide with the size of the
interior radius of the container. The 10 × 10 **ARRAY** with the
**ARRAY** boundary is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-29`.

The **UNIT** containing the **ARRAY** is now placed within the global
unit using a **HOLE** content record. The location of the **HOLE** is
determined using **ORIGIN** data to match the origin of the **UNIT** in
the **HOLE** with an X, Y, Z position in the surrounding **UNIT**. In
this problem, the origin of the **UNIT** must be at position (0,0,0).
Since only nonzero data must be entered, **ORIGIN** data are not needed
for this problem. The boundary region consists of the steel container.

The overall problem description is shown below. Two of the color plots
used for verification of this mockup are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-30` and
:numref:`fig8-1-31`. The black outside border of the two color plots indicates
volume outside the global unit. The plot can be extended just outside
the global unit boundary to ensure that the entire problem is included
in the plot. This results in a black area surrounding the actual
problem.

A typical PWR shipping cask is illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-32`. The interior
and exterior shell of the cask is carbon steel (mixture 7), and a
depleted uranium gamma shield (mixture 6) is present in the annulus
between the steel layers. The shipping cask contains seven PWR fuel
assemblies. Each assembly is a 17 × 17 **ARRAY** of fuel rods with water
holes. Each assembly is contained in a stainless steel (mixture 5) box.
Each fuel rod is composed of 4% enriched UO\ :sub:`2` (mixture 1) clad
with Zircaloy (mixture 2). Rods of B\ :sub:`4`\ C clad (mixture 4) with
stainless steel are positioned between the fuel assemblies. The entire
cask is filled with water (mixture 3).

The next step is to create the central array of three fuel assemblies
with B\ :sub:`4`\ C rods between them. In KENO V.a, this is done by
stacking fuel assemblies in storage cells (**UNIT** 7) and
B\ :sub:`4`\ C rod arrays (**UNIT** 8) into an array (**ARRAY** 3) and
placing it in a **UNIT** (**UNIT** 9). In KENO-VI description, **UNIT**
7 (fuel assembly in storage cell) and the array of B\ :sub:`4`\ C rods
(**ARRAY** 2) are directly placed into a **UNIT** (**UNIT** 8). The

In KENO V.a, **UNIT** 13 is simply a cylindrical lid that fits on top of
the shipping cask. It is described relative to the origin of the
shipping cask and is made of depleted uranium.

  UNIT 13
  CYLINDER  6 1 47.625 457.2 449.58

All necessary subassemblies that make up the shipping cask have been
built. The shipping cask is completed by specifying the origin of the
central section (**ARRAY** 6 in KENO V.a) (see :numref:`fig8-1-39`) to be at the
center of the array in X and Y and the bottom of the array in the Z
direction. A cylinder of water defining the interior of the shipping
cask is described around the array. In the KENO V.a geometry, a **HOLE**
is used to place **UNIT** 12 (:numref:`fig8-1-40`) below the array, and a second
HOLE is used to place another **UNIT** 12 above the array. In the
KENO-VI geometry, **UNIT** 9 is placed as a **HOLE** above and below the
central array. Then a cylinder of steel is placed around the water,
which is in turn encased by depleted uranium. The depleted uranium is
then contained in the outer steel cylinder of the shipping cask. In KENO
V.a description, a third **HOLE** is used to place the depleted uranium
lid (**UNIT** 13) on the shipping cask. This completes the shipping cask
description of :numref:`fig8-1-32`

The geometry data for this shipping cask are shown below. The plot data
have been included for verification of the geometry description.
However, the plot generated by this data is quite large and is therefore
not included in this document.

Triangular pitched arrays in KENO-VI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 21.

Triangular pitched **ARRAY**\ s can be described in KENO-VI
by defining the **UNIT**\ s that make up the **ARRAY** as **HEXPRISM**
and in the array data block setting **TYP**\ =TRIANGULAR, HEXAGONAL,
SHEXAGONAL, or RHEXAGONAL. This includes close-packed triangular pitched
arrays. Since the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by stacking hexprisms,
care must be taken to ensure that the **ARRAY** boundary is completely
enclosed within the stacked **UNIT**. Below is an example of a
triangular pitched **ARRAY**.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the **HEXPRISM**\ s that make up
the **ARRAY**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel cell stacked in a triangular
pitched or hexagonal lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to
fill in the **ARRAY** so the array boundary is contained within the
stacked **UNIT**\ s. Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2
contains void. :numref:`fig8-1-41` shows an X-Y cross section schematic of
**UNIT**\ s 1 and 2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY** **BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated triangular
pitched assembly of 7 cells. Unrotated triangular or hexagonal pitched
arrays can be set up in two array configurations. The first
configuration, selected using the **TYP**\ = followed by keyword
**HEXAGONAL** or **TRIANGULAR**, stacks the **UNIT**\ s so that the
faces perpendicular to the X axis meet. Each consecutive row in the Y
direction begins ½ of the face-to-face dimension farther over in the
positive X direction than in the previous row. The second configuration,
selected using the **TYP**\ = followed by keyword **SHEXAGONAL**, also
stacks the **UNIT**\ s so that the faces perpendicular to the X axis
meet. However, for this type of **ARRAY**, the odd numbered rows in the
Y direction (1, 3, 5, etc.) begin at the left edge of the **ARRAY**, and
the even numbered rows in the Y direction (2, 4, 6, etc.) begin ½ of the
face-to-face dimension to the right of the left edge of the **ARRAY**.
:numref:`fig8-1-42` and :numref:`fig8-1-43` show X-Y cross section schematics of the
assembly for the two different unrotated hexagonal **ARRAY** types.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 21a.

Another hexagonal **ARRAY** type involves stacking rotated hexprisms,
which are hexprisms rotated 30°/ 90º so that the flat faces
perpendicular to the Y axis now meet. Rotated hexagonal arrays are
specified by setting **TYP**\ =\ **RHEXAGONAL** in the array data block.
Because the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by stacking hexprisms, care
must be taken to ensure the array boundary is completely enclosed within
the stacked **UNIT**. Below is an example of a rotated hexagonal pitched
**ARRAY**.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the rotated hexprisms that make up
the **ARRAY**. They are specified using the geometry keyword
**RHEXPRISM**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel cell that is stacked in a rotated
hexagonal lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to fill in the
**ARRAY** so that the **ARRAY BOUNDARY** is contained within the stacked
**UNIT**\ s. Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2 contains
void. :numref:`fig8-1-45` shows an X-Y cross section schematic of **UNIT**\ s 1
and 2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated rotated hexagonal
pitched assembly of 7 cells. The rotated hexagonal array type is
specified in the array data block using **TYP**\ = with the keyword
**RHEXAGONAL**. This **ARRAY** type stacks the **UNIT**\ s so the faces
perpendicular to the Y axis meet. In the odd numbered columns (i.e., 1,
3, 5, etc.), the **UNIT**\ s are stacked so the columns begin at the
lower edge of the array and in the even numbered columns (i.e., 2, 4, 6,
etc.), the **UNIT**\ s are stacked so the columns begin ½ of the
face-to-face dimension above the lower edge of the **ARRAY**.

Triangular pitched Arrays in KENO V.a
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Triangular pitched arrays can be described in KENO V.a geometry by
properly defining the basic unit from which the array can be built. This
includes close-packed triangular pitched arrays. Two geometry
configurations are described below.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1. Bare Triangular pitched Array.

:numref:`fig8-1-48` illustrates a small close-packed triangular pitched
**ARRAY**. Each rod in the **ARRAY** has a radius of 2.0 cm, and the
pitch of the **ARRAY** is 4 cm. To create this **ARRAY**, describe five
units as defined in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

Assume the rods described in the **ARRAY** are each 2.0 cm in radius and
100 cm tall. The rods are composed of mixture 1. The geometry
descriptions for the first four **UNIT**\ s are given below.

::

  UNIT 1
  ZHEMICYL-Y 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 2
  ZHEMICYL+Y 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 3
  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  :align: center
  :width: 400

  Units used to describe a bare triangular pitched ARRAY.

To describe **UNIT** 5, the origin of the **UNIT** is defined to be at
its center. One of the hemicylinders is built into the box, and the
other three are added as holes. In this example, the +X hemicylinder is
built into the box, and the other hemicylinders are inserted as holes.
(Because the +X hemicylinder is built into **UNIT** 5, **UNIT** 4 is not
used in the problem.) The half dimension of the box in the X dimension
is equal to the radius, 2.0 cm. The half dimension of the box in the
Y direction is :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}` times the pitch (0.866025 \* 4.0) or 3.46411 cm.
**UNIT** 5 is described below.

::

  UNIT 5
  ZHEMICYL+X  1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0 ORIGIN -2.0 0.0
  CUBOID  0 1 2P2.0 2P3.46411 2P50.0
  HOLE 1 0.0  3.46411	0.0
  HOLE 2 0.0 -3.46411	0.0
  HOLE 3 2.0         	0.0

In the description of **UNIT** 5, the **ZHEMICYL+X** places the
hemicylinder at the left of the box. **HOLE** 1 places the top
hemicylinder, **HOLE** 2 places the bottom hemicylinder, and **HOLE** 3
places the hemicylinder at the right of the box.

Next, a **UNIT** 6 is defined that can be used to complete the lower rod
of **UNIT** 5. A **UNIT** 7 is defined that can be used to complete the
upper rod of **UNIT** 5. **UNIT** 8 is defined to complete the left rod
of **UNIT** 5, and **UNIT** 9 is defined to complete the right rod of
**UNIT** 5. **UNIT** 10 is defined to complete the corners of the
overall **ARRAY**. The input data for these **UNIT**\ s are given below
and are illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-50`.

The bottom row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data entries
10 4R6 10. The second row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data
entries 8 4R5 9. The third row is filled by repeating the previous six
entries (1Q6). It could also have been described by entering 8 4R5 9.
The top row of the **ARRAY** is described by the data entries 10 4R7 10.

:numref:`fig8-1-52` illustrates a close-packed triangular pitched **ARRAY** in a
cylinder. This array may be described by defining five basic units that
are the same as those of Example 1 shown in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

To describe **UNIT** 5, the origin of the **UNIT** to be at its center
is defined. One of the hemicylinders is built into the box, and the
other three are added as **HOLE**\ s. In this example, the
+X hemicylinder is built into the box, and the other hemicylinders are
inserted as **HOLE**\ s. The half dimension of the box in the
X dimension is equal to the radius, 2.0 cm. The half dimension of the
box in the Y direction is :math:`\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}` times the pitch (0.866025 * 4.0) or
3.46411 cm. **UNIT** 5 is described below.

  HOLE 2  0.0 -3.46411 0.0
  HOLE 3  2.0  0.0     0.0

In the description of **UNIT** 5, the **ZHEMICYL+X** places the
hemicylinder at the left of the box. **HOLE** 1 places the top
hemicylinder, **HOLE** 2 places the bottom hemicylinder, and **HOLE** 3
places the hemicylinder at the right of the box.

To describe the base **ARRAY** of the problem, **UNIT**\ s 5 is stacked
in a 4 × 2 × 1 array as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The input data for the
**ARRAY** are the following:

::

  ARA=1 NUX=4 NUY=2 NUZ=1  FILL F5 END FILL

.. _fig8-1-53:

  4 × 2 × 1 array to be placed within a cylinder.

Next, the **ARRAY** is placed within the cylinder. This is done by
placing the **ARRAY** in a **UNIT**, defined here to be **UNIT** 6. The
origin of the cylinder has been defined to be at the center of the
**ARRAY**. The resulting geometry is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-54`.

  CYLINDER 0 1 12.4  2P50.0
  CYLINDER 2 1 12.65 2P50.0

Next, the hemicylinders necessary to complete all of the half cylinders
remaining in :numref:`fig8-1-54` are added. This is done by placing four
**UNIT**\ s 1 at the appropriate positions along the bottom of the
**ARRAY**, four **UNIT**\ s 2 at the top of the **ARRAY**, two
**UNIT**\ s 3 at the left of the **ARRAY**, and two **UNIT**\ s 4 at the
right of the **ARRAY**. The input data are shown below, and the
resulting configuration is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-55`. In **UNIT** 6, the
first **HOLE** 1 places a **UNIT** 1 under the lower left **UNIT** of
the **ARRAY**. The second **HOLE** 1 places a **UNIT** 1 under the next
**ARRAY** **UNIT** to the right of the first one. This procedure is
repeated for the next two lower **ARRAY** **UNIT**\ s, thus completing
the lower row of cylinders. Similarly, the first **HOLE** 2 places a
**UNIT** 2 above the upper left **UNIT** of the **ARRAY**. The second
**HOLE** 2 places a **UNIT** 1 to the right of the first one, etc.,
until the four cylinders at the top of the **ARRAY** are completed. The
first **HOLE** 3 places a **UNIT** 3 at the lower left side of the
**ARRAY** to complete that rod. The second **HOLE** 3 completes the rod
above it. The first **HOLE** 4 completes the lower rod on the right side
of the **ARRAY**. The second **HOLE** 4 completes the rod above it. The
geometry data listed below result in the configuration shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-55`.

To complete the desired configuration, a cylinder is defined, **UNIT**
7, and it is placed at the four appropriate positions as shown below.
The first **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder of **UNIT** 7 at the left of
the **ARRAY**, the second **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the top of
the **ARRAY**, the third **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the right of
the **ARRAY**, and the fourth **HOLE** 7 places the cylinder at the
bottom of the **ARRAY**. The completed configuration is shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-56`. It is not necessary for **UNIT** 7 to precede **UNIT** 6.
It is allowable to place **UNIT** 7 after **UNIT** 6 in the input data.
Because the final configuration is defined in **UNIT** 6, it must be
designated as the **GLOBAL UNIT**. The total geometry input for this
example is listed below.

Consider the triangular pitched **ARRAY** shown in :numref:`fig8-1-52`. Another
method of describing this configuration is given below. Four basic
**UNIT**\ s are defined, as listed below. These are the same **UNIT**\ s
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

  ZHEMICYL-X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

  UNIT 4
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0

**UNIT** 5 is the same as previously defined in Example 2a, and pictured
in :numref:`fig8-1-49`.

::

  UNIT 5
  ZHEMICYL+X 1 1 2.0 50.0 -50.0 ORIGIN -2.0 0.0

  HOLE 2  0.0 -3.46411 0.0
  HOLE 3  2.0  0.0     0.0

To describe the basic array for the problem, **UNIT**\ s 5 is stacked in
a 4 × 2 × 1 as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The input data for the **ARRAY**
are the following:

::

  ARA=1 NUX=4 NUY=2 NUZ=1  FILL F5 END FILL

Next, the **ARRAY** (**ARRAY** 1) is placed in **UNIT** 6, and
**UNIT**\ s 7 and 8 are defined to be placed to the left and right of it
(see :numref:`fig8-1-57`). **UNIT** 7 will complete the two rods at the left
boundary of the **ARRAY** and will contain half of the far left rod in
the completed configuration. In the description of **UNIT** 7, the
**ZHEMICYL+X** is half of the far right rod and is located with its cut
face at the left boundary of a box that is as tall as the entire
**ARRAY** of :numref:`fig8-1-53`. The first **HOLE** 3 in **UNIT** 7 completes
the lower left rod of that **ARRAY**, and the second **HOLE** 3
completes the upper left rod. **UNIT** 8 is constructed in similar
fashion to complete the two rods at the right of the **ARRAY** shown in
Fig. 8.1.53. **UNIT** 8 is the mirror image of **UNIT** 7.
**UNIT**\ s 6, 7, and 8 are stacked in an **ARRAY** (**ARRAY** 2) to
achieve the configuration shown in :numref:`fig8-1-57`. The data to accomplish
this are listed below.

Dodecahedral pitched arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 22.

Dodecahedral pitched **ARRAY**\ s can be described in
KENO-VI by defining the **UNIT**\ s that make up the **ARRAY** as
dodecahedra and in the **ARRAY** data block setting
**TYP**\ =DODECAHEDRAL. Since the **ARRAY**\ s are constructed by
stacking dodecahedra, care must be taken to ensure the **ARRAY**
boundary is completely enclosed within the stacked unit. Below is an
example of a dodecahedral **ARRAY** that represents a close packed
**ARRAY** of spheres.

The first and second **UNIT**\ s are the dodecahedra that make up the
**ARRAY**. **UNIT** 1 is the fuel sphere stacked in a dodecahedral
lattice. **UNIT** 2 is a dummy **UNIT** used to fill in the **ARRAY** so
the **ARRAY** boundary is contained within the stacked **UNIT**\ s.
Since the **ARRAY** is not moderated, **UNIT** 2 contains void.
:numref:`fig8-1-62` shows an isometric, cross section view of **UNIT**\ s 1 and
2.

**UNIT** 3 is the **GLOBAL UNIT** that contains the **ARRAY** and
**ARRAY BOUNDARY**. The **ARRAY** is an unmoderated triangular pitched
assembly of 17 fuel spheres. Dodecahedral **ARRAY**\ s are specified by
using **TYP**\ = followed by keyword dodecahedral in the array data
block. The X and Y coordinates are stacked together as a square pitched
**ARRAY** with the pitch equal to twice the dodecahedron radius. In the
Z dimension, the odd Z planes (Z = 1, 3, 5, etc.) have the X and
Y \ **UNIT**\ s begin at the most negative edge of the **ARRAY**, while
the even Z planes (Z = 2, 4, 6, etc.) have the X and Y \ **UNIT**\ s
begin one dodecahedron inscribed sphere radius in the positive direction
from the most negative edge of the **ARRAY**. Also, the Z distance
between the centers of the **UNIT**\ s in successive Z planes is the
square root of 2.0 times the dodecahedron radius (or the dodecahedron
diameter divided by the square root of 2.0). :numref:`fig8-1-63` and :numref:`fig8-1-64`
show X-Y cross sectional color plots of the assembly at an odd and even

Alternative sample problem mockups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The geometry data for KENO can often be described correctly in several
ways. Some alternative geometry descriptions are given here for sample
problems C.12 and C.13. (See Appendix C of the KENO manual.)

.. _8-1-3-7-1:

Sample Problem C.12, First Alternative
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mockup maintains the same overall unit dimensions that were used in
sample problem C.12. In sample problem C.12, the origin of **UNIT** 1,
the solution cylinder, is at the center of the unit; the origin of
**UNIT**\ s 2, 3, 4, and 5, the metal cylinders, are at the center of
the cylinders. In this mockup, the unit numbers remain the same and the
origin of each unit is at the center of the unit. In each unit the
cylinder is offset by specifying the position of its centerline relative
to the origin of the **UNIT**.

In this mockup, the outer boundaries of the system are made as close
fitting as possible on all six faces. The origin of each **UNIT** is
located at the center of the cylinder. **UNIT**\ s 1, 3, 5, and 7
contain the metal cylinders. **UNIT**\ s 2, 4, 6, and 8 contain the
solution cylinders.

Biasing or weighting data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`8-1-3-6-3` discusses the basis of weighting or biasing. The use of
biasing data in reflected problems has been illustrated in Examples 9,
10, and 11 of :ref:`8-1-3-6`. :ref:`8-1-2-7` discusses the input
directions for entering biasing data.

Every **shape** card in KENO V.a, or **MEDIA** card in KENO-VI requires
a bias ID to associate that geometry region with a biasing or weighting
function. A biasing or weighting function is a set of energy-dependent
values of the average weight that are applicable in a given region. The
default function for all bias IDs is constant through all energy groups
and is defined to be the default value of weight average which can be
specified in the parameter data. A bias ID can be associated with a
biasing function (other than default) by specifying it in the biasing
input data. This function can be chosen from the weighting library, or
it can be entered from records. :numref:`tab8-1-20` lists the materials and
energy group structures for biasing functions available from the
weighting library.

In general, the use of biasing should be restricted to external
reflectors unless the user has generated correct biasing functions for
other applications. Improper use of biasing functions can result in
erroneous answers without giving any indication that they are invalid.
Caution should be exercised in the generation and use of biasing
functions.

Biasing functions are most applicable to thick external reflectors.
Their use can significantly reduce the amount of computer time required
to obtain answers in KENO. If the user wishes to use a biasing function
for a concrete reflector, for example, the following steps must be
included in preparing the input data:

1. The geometry region data must define the shape and dimensions of the
reflector using the mixture ID for concrete and a sequence of bias IDs
that associate the geometry region with the appropriate interval of the
concrete weighting function. CAUTION: THE THICKNESS AND SEQUENTIAL
LOCATION OF EACH REGION USING BIASING FUNCTIONS MUST MATCH OR VERY
NEARLY MATCH THE INCREMENT THICKNESS AND ORDER OF THE WEIGHTING DATA. NO
CHECK IS MADE ON THE REQUIREMENT. IT IS THE USER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO
ENSURE CONSISTENCY.

2. Biasing data must be entered. This must include the material ID for
the reflector material (from :numref:`tab8-1-20` or as specified on records)
and a beginning and ending bias ID. The beginning bias ID is used to
select the first set of energy-dependent average weights, and the
subsequent sets of energy-dependent average weights are assigned
consecutive IDs until the ending bias ID is reached.

Small deviations in reflector region thickness are allowed, such as
using three generated regions with a thickness per region of 5.08 cm to
generate a 15.24 cm thick reflector of concrete, or using five generated
regions with a thickness per region of 3.048 cm to generate a 15.24 cm
thick reflector of water. See :numref:`tab8-1-20` for a list of the increment
thicknesses for the materials in the weighting library. It is acceptable
for the thickness of the last reflector region to be significantly
different than the increment thickness. For example, a reflector record
specifying five generated regions with a thickness per region of 3.0 cm
could be followed by a reflector record specifying one region with a
thickness per region of 0.24 cm. Assuming that material 2 is water and a
15.24 cm thick cuboidal reflector of water is desired, the required
reflector description and biasing data could be entered as follows:

Here the weighting functions associated with bias IDs 2, 3, 4, and 5
each have a thickness of 3.0 cm, corresponding exactly to the increment
thickness for water in :numref:`tab8-1-20` Bias ID 6 is used for the last
generated region which is 3.24 cm thick.

The following examples illustrate the use of biasing data. Suppose the
user wishes to use the weighting function for water from Table 8.1.20
for bias IDs 2 through 6. The biasing input data would then be:

::

  READ BIAS  ID=500 2 6 END BIAS

The energy-dependent values of weight average for the first 3 cm
interval of water will be used for weighting the geometry regions that
specify a bias ID of 2. The energy-dependent values of weight average
for the second 3 cm interval of water will be used for geometry regions
that specify a bias ID of 3, etc. Thus, the energy-dependent values of
weight average for the fifth 3 cm interval of water will be used for
geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 6. Geometry regions that use
bias IDs other than 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will use the default value of
weight average that is constant for all energies as a biasing function.

Several sets of biasing data can be entered at once. Assume the user
wishes to use the weighting function for concrete from :numref:`tab8-1-20` for
bias IDs 2 through 4 and the weighting function for water for bias IDs 5
through 7. The appropriate input data block is the following:

::

  READ BIAS  ID=301 2 4 ID=500 5 7 END BIAS

The energy-dependent values of weight average for the first 5 cm
interval of concrete will be used for the geometry regions that specify
a bias ID of 2, the energy-dependent values of weight average for the
second 5 cm interval of concrete will be used for the geometry regions
that specify a bias ID of 3, and the energy-dependent values of weight
average for the third 5 cm interval of concrete will be used for the
geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 4. The energy-dependent
values of weight average for the first 3 cm interval of water will be
used for geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 5, the values for
the second 3 cm interval of water will be used for geometry regions that
specify a bias ID of 6, and the values for the third 3 cm interval of
water will be used for geometry regions that specify a bias ID of 7. The
default value of weight average will be used for all bias IDs outside
the range of 2–7.

If the biasing data block defines the same bias ID more than once, the
value that is entered last supersedes previous entries. Assuming that
the following data block is entered,

::

  READ BIAS  ID=400 2 7 ID=500 5 7 END BIAS

the data for paraffin (ID=400) will be used for bias IDs 2, 3, and 4,
and the data for water (ID=500) will be used for bias IDs 5, 6, and 7.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1. USE OF BIASING DATA

It is assumed that a 5 cm radius sphere of material 2 is reflected by a
20 cm thickness of material 1 (concrete). The concrete reflector is
spherical and close fitting upon the sphere of material 2. The mixing
table must specify material 1 and material 2. Material 1 must be defined
as concrete. The geometry and biasing data should be entered as follows:

The bias ID for the first generated region is 2, the second is 3, the
third is 4, and the fourth is 5. The biasing data block specifies that
the biasing function for material ID 301 (concrete) will be used from
the weighting library. The bias ID to which the energy-dependent
weighting function for the first 5.0 cm interval of concrete is applied
is 2; the energy-dependent weighting function for the fourth 5 cm
interval of concrete is applied to the fourth generated geometry region.
This generated region has a bias ID of 5.

In KENO V.a, Example 1 can also be described without using a reflector
record as shown below. The records that are generated by the reflector
record in the previous set of data are identical to the last four
spheres in this mockup.

Color plots
~~~~~~~~~~~

Plots are generated only if a plot data block has been entered for the
problem and **PLT**\ =NO has not been entered in the parameter data or
the plot data. See :ref:`8-1-2-11` for a description of plot data. When a
plot is to be made, the user MUST correctly specify the upper left-hand
corner of the plot with respect to the origin of the plot. The origin of
a plot is defined as the origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT**.

Plots can represent mixture numbers, unit numbers, or bias ID numbers. A
title can be entered for each plot. If plot titles are omitted, the
title of the KENO case will be printed for each plot title until a plot
title is entered. If a plot title is entered and a subsequent plot title
is omitted, the last plot title prior to the omitted one will be used
for the omitted one.

The upper left and lower right coordinates define the area (i.e., the
slice and its location) for which the plot is to be made. The direction
cosines across the plot and the direction cosines down the plot define
the direction of the vector across the plot and the vector down the plot
with respect to the geometry coordinate system. One of the simplest ways
of generating a plot is to specify the desired coordinates of the upper
left and lower right corners of the plot. Then one must determine which
plot axis is to be across the plot and which is to be down. The sign of
the direction cosine should be consistent with the direction of that
component when moving from the upper left to lower right corner. For
example, to draw a plot of an X‑Z slice at Y = 5.0 with X across the
plot and Z down the plot for a system whose X coordinates ranges from
0.0 to 10.0 and whose Z coordinates range from 0.0 to 20.0, the upper
left coordinate could be **XUL**\ =0.0 **YUL**\ =5.0 **ZUL**\ =20.0 and
the lower right coordinates could be **XLR**\ =10.0 **YLR**\ =5.0
**ZLR**\ =0.0. Since X is to be plotted across the plot with X = 0.0 at
the left and X = 10.0 at the right, only the X component of the
direction cosines across the plot need be entered. It should be positive
because going from 0.0 to 10.0 is moving in the positive direction.
Thus, **UAX**\ =1.0 would be entered for the direction cosines across
the plot. **VAX** and **WAX** could be omitted. Z is to be plotted down
the plot with Z = 20.0 at the top and Z = 0.0 at the bottom. Therefore,
only the Z component of the direction cosines down the plot needs to be
defined. It should be negative because moving from 20.0 to 0.0 is moving
in the negative direction. Thus, **WDN** = −1.0 would be entered for the
direction cosines down the plot. **UDN** and **VDN** could be omitted.
The sign of the direction cosines should be consistent with the
coordinates of the upper left and lower right corners in order to get a
plot.

It is not necessary that the plot be made for a slice orthogonal to one
of the axes. Plots can be made of slices cut at any desired angle, but
the user should exercise caution and be well aware of the distortion of
shapes that can be introduced. (Nonorthogonal slices through cylinders
plot as ellipses.)

The user can specify the horizontal and vertical spacing between points
on the plot. It is usually advisable to enter one or the other. Entering
both can cause distortion of the plot. **DLX**\ = is used to specify the
horizontal spacing between points and **DLD**\ = is used to specify the
vertical spacing between points. When only one of them is specified, the
code calculates the correct value of the other so the plot will not be
distorted. **DLX** or **DLD** can be specified by the user to be small
enough to show the desirable detail in the plot. The plot is generated
by starting at the upper left corner of the plot and generating a point
every **DLX** across the plot; then moving down **DLD** and repeating
the generation of the points across the plot.

**NAX** specifies the number of intervals (pixels) that will be printed
across the plot. **NDN** specifies the number of intervals (pixels) that
will be printed down the plot. If both **NAX** and **NDN** are entered,
the plot may be distorted. If one of them is entered, the value of the
other will be calculated so the plot will not be distorted.

When a plot is being made, the first pixel represents the coordinates of
the upper left corner. The value of **DELV** is added to the coordinate
that is to be printed across the plot, and the next pixel is printed.
**DELV** is added to that value to determine the location of the next
pixel, that is, a point is determined every **DELV** across the plot and
a pixel is printed for each point. When a line has been completed, a new
line is begun **DELU** from the first line. This procedure is repeated
until the plot is complete.

The plot data blocks included above are set up to draw a mixture map of
an X-Y slice taken at the half height (Z=0.0) and a unit map for the
same slice. In the above examples, the geometry dimensions extend from X
= −4.3 to X = 4.3, from Y = −4.3, to Y = 4.3, and from Z = −16.0 to Z =
16.0. An X-Y slice is be printed at the half height (Z = 0.0). The
desired plot data sets the upper left-hand corner of the plot to be
X = −4.6 and Y = 4.6. The lower right-hand corner of the plot is
specified as X = 4.6 and Y = −4.6. These data are entered by specifying
the upper left-hand corner as **XUL**\ = −4.6 **YUL**\ =4.6
**ZUL**\ =0.0 and the lower right-hand corner as **XLR**\ =4.6
**YLR**\ = −4.6 **ZLR**\ =0.0. It is desired to print X across the plot
and Y down the plot. Therefore, the X direction cosine is specified
across the plot, in the direction from X = −4.6 to X = 4.6 as
**UAX**\ =1.0. The Y direction cosine is specified down the plot, from
Y = 4.6 to Y = −4.6 as **VDN**\ = −1.0.

A black border will be printed for points outside the range of the
problem geometry description. By setting the plot dimension slightly
larger than the geometry dimension, a black border will be printed
around the specified plot. This verifies that the outer boundaries of
the geometry are contained within the plot dimensions. NAX is the number
of pixels across for a color plot. An initial recommended range for NAX
is between 600 and 800 pixels. The resulting plots are shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-65` and :numref:`fig8-1-66`. The associated data for both plots are
shown in :numref:`list8-1-1` and :numref:`list8-1-2`.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 2. SINGLE UNIT WITH OFFSET ORIGIN.

The physical problem is the same as that described in Example 1: two
concentric cylinders in a cuboid. The dimensions are exactly the same,
and the difference is in the choice of the origin. In this geometry
description, the origin was specified as the most negative point of the
unit. Thus, the cylinders must have an origin specified to center them
in the cuboid, and the cuboid extends from 0.0 to 8.6 in X and Y and
from 0.0 to 32 in Z as shown in the problem description below.

The plot data included above will draw a mixture map of an X-Y slice
taken at the half height (Z = 16.0). It will also draw a unit map of the
same slice. The plot dimensions extend 0.3 cm beyond the problem
dimensions to provide a black border around the plot. The associated
plot data specification for the mixture map is shown in :numref:`list8-1-3`, the
mixture map is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-70`, and the associated plot data for
the unit map is shown in :numref:`list8-1-4`. The unit map is identical to
:numref:`fig8-1-66` and is not included.

As stated at the beginning of :ref:`8-1-3-9`, the origin of a plot is
defined as the origin of the **GLOBAL UNIT**. Each individual unit in
the array is 8.6 cm wide in X and Y and 32 cm high in Z. Since the array
has two units stacked in each direction, the array is 17.2 cm wide in X
and Y and is 64 cm high. Therefore, the array exists from X = 0.0 to X =
17.2, from Y = 0.0 to Y = 17.2 and from Z = 0.0 to Z = 64.0.

The first color plot is to generate an X-Y slice through the array at
the half height (Z = 16.0 cm) of the first layer as shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-72`. It is desirable to create an image with a larger extent
than the global unit to ensure that the boundaries are as expected. This
is achieved by setting the boundaries of the plot larger than the array.
In this case, the boundaries were arbitrarily set 0.3 cm larger than the
array, resulting in a black border around the array. If the plot were to
exclude everything external to the array, the following coordinates
could have been entered: **XUL**\ =0.0 **YUL**\ =17.2 **ZUL**\ =16.0
**XLR**\ =17.2 **YLR**\ =0.0 **ZLR**\ =16.0. This would have eliminated
the black border. The existing plot was made using **XUL**\ = −0.3
**YUL**\ =17.5 **ZUL**\ =16.0 **XLR**\ =17.5 **YLR**\ = −0.3
**ZLR**\ =16.0.

  X-Y plot of 2 × 2 × 2 bare array.

The second color plot is to generate an X-Z slice through the center of
the front row of the array. In order to obtain a black border, the
coordinates of X and Z were arbitrarily set 1.0 cm larger than the
boundaries of the array. The center of the front row occurs at Y = 12.9.
The coordinates of the plot were: **XUL**\ = −1.0 **ZUL**\ =65.0
**YUL**\ =12.9 **XLR**\ =18.2 **ZLR**\ = −1.0 **YLR**\ =12.9. The
resulting mixture map is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-73`.

The **ARRAY** record specifies the array number and the coordinates of
the most negative point of the array to be (0.0,0.0,0.0) and the
coordinates of the most positive point to be (17.2,17.2,64.0). Thus the
reflected array extends from -15.24 cm to +32.44 cm in X and Y and from
-15.24 to +79.24 in Z.

The first color plot for this example is to show an X-Y slice through
the array and reflector at the half height of the bottom layer. A black
border is used to verify that the entire reflector has been shown. This
is accomplished by arbitrarily setting the plot boundaries 1 cm beyond
the reflector boundaries. The coordinates used for this plot are **XUL**
= −16.24 **YUL** = 33.44 **ZUL** = 16.0 **XLR** = 33.44 **YLR** = 16.24
**ZLR** = 16.0. The plot data description is shown in :numref:`list8-1-5`, and
the plot is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-75`.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 5. A 2 × 2 × 2 REFLECTED ARRAY WITH THE ORIGIN CENTERED IN THE
  ARRAY

This example is physically identical to Example 4. The difference is in
the specification of the origin. The bare array is 17.2 cm wide in X and
Y and 64 cm high. The origin (0,0,0) can be placed at the exact center
of the array by specifying the most negative point of the array as X =
−8.6, Y = −8.6 and Z = −32.0. This is done using the **ARRAY**
description in the geometry block. Because the origin is located at a
different position, the coordinates of the plots will also be different.
The input data description for this example is given below.

.he plot data description for the **UNIT** plot of nested holes is shown
in :numref:`list8-1-13`. The **UNIT** plot is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-92`. The user can
reference this map to verify the correct placement of the **UNIT**\ s.
Note that the **UNIT** map plots the **UNIT**\ s present at the deepest
nesting level for the 2-D slice. It does not show any detail within a
**UNIT**. The apparent detail within **UNIT** 7 includes
**UNIT**\ s 1–6, which were placed there via the hole option. In the
legend of the plot, the material number actually refers to the **UNIT**
number.

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 7. LARGE STORAGE ARRAY.

The storage array described Example 18 in :ref:`8-1-3-6-3` and
:numref:`fig8-1-27` is such a sparse array that the mixture map had to be very
large in order to show the detail of the shelves and uranium buttons.
The mixture maps for this configuration were not presented in
:ref:`8-1-3-6-3`, but the data description was listed so the user can
generate them. It may be useful to generate a **UNIT** map for this kind
of problem. The input data for generating unit maps for this storage
array is given below.

KENO Multiple Mesh and Mesh-based Quantity Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KENO creates a grid and stores several mesh definitions in this object.
The following mesh definitions are supported by KENO:

i. Default mesh (grid **ID** =10001):

KENO generates a 5 × 5 × 5 Cartesian mesh which overlays the entire
geometry. This mesh is always used for fission source convergence
diagnostics if the user does not specify any mesh for this quantity.
Currently users cannot enter grid **ID**\ s greater than 9999.

ii. Simple mesh (grid **ID** = 20001):

KENO generates a uniform simple mesh with the mesh size specified by the
user with the MSH parameter, which is introduced in Table 9.1.1. This
mesh definition is only used for mesh flux calculations.

iii. Mesh with **READ GRID** block (grid **ID** = NUMBER):

The user can specify either a mesh with a single **READ GRID** block or
multiple meshes by repeating the **READ GRID** block with different mesh
definitions. Note that the entire block, including **READ GRID** and
**END GRID**, must be repeated each time; this behavior is different
from all other blocks of KENO input.

After setting up all mesh, KENO tries to match the IDs specified in the
parameter block with the keywords **SCD**, **MFX**, **CDS**, **CGD**,
and **GFX** (See :ref:`8-1-2-3`) to the grid **ID** in each grid
definition. Each mesh-based quantity requested by the user is associated
with a grid if the requested grid **ID** exists.

The following examples demonstrate the mesh features in KENO:

.. centered:: EXAMPLE 1: SOURCE CONVERGENCE DIAGNOSTICS WITH DEFAULT MESH


KENO always generates a default mesh for source convergence diagnostics
if the user does not specify any mesh for this quantity. The following
example (only KENO-VI version is shown) will be used in all examples in
this section to summarize several mesh definition scenarios with several
mesh-based quantity requests. In this sample problem, a bounding box is
defined to enclose the entire geometry with xmin=‑13.01, xmax=13.01,
ymin=-13.74, ymax=13.74, zmin=-13.74, and zmax=13.74. KENO uses this
bounding box and creates a 5 × 5 × 5 grid for source convergence
diagnostics.

different grid rather than the default grid for source convergence
diagnostics. In this example, the sample problem specified in EXAMPLE 1
is modified for this purpose. A new 6x6x6 grid is defined over the

source convergence diagnostics are requested by setting **SCD**
parameter to 12 in the parameter block that matches the NUMBER

This example demonstrates the multiple mesh definition for multiple
mesh-based quantities. Our sample problem is modified so that (1) two
grids have been defined with the **READ GRID** data block, and (2) both
the source convergence diagnostics and mesh flux tally are requested. In
this sample, the grid with grid ID = 12 is assigned to the source
convergence diagnostics, and the grid with grid ID = 1 is assigned to
the mesh flux tally.

Random sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random-number package used by KENO always starts with the same seed
and thus always reproduces the same sequence of random numbers. Any
random number except the one printed as the starting random number in
the parameter table can be used to activate a different random sequence.
The user can rerun a problem with a different random sequence by simply
entering a hexadecimal random number other than the starting random
number in the parameter data. For example, by entering RND=A10C1893E6D5
in the parameter data, the problem will be run with a different random
sequence.

.. _8-1-3-12:

Matrix k-effective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix k-effective calculations provide an alternative method of
calculating the k-effective of the system. Cofactor k-effectives and
source vectors are additional information that can be provided when the
matrix k-effective is calculated. The necessary source and fission
weight data are collected during the neutron tracking procedure. This
information is converted to a FISSION PRODUCTION MATRIX, which is the
number of next generation neutrons produced at J by a neutron born at I.
The principal eigenvalue of the fission probability matrix is the matrix
k-effective. KENO offers four alternatives when calculating matrix
k-effective as discussed below:

(1) If **MKP**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by array position or position index in
the GLOBAL ARRAY. The position index is used to reference a given
location in a 3-D lattice. For a 2 × 2 × 2 array, there are nine unique
position indices as shown below. Position zero contains everything
outside the GLOBAL ARRAY.

  +---+----------+---+---+

The fission production matrix is the number of next generation neutrons
produced at index J by a neutron born at index I. This matrix is used to
calculate the matrix k-effective, cofactor k‑effectives and the source
vector by position index. Because the size of the fission probability
matrix is the square of the array size (for a 4 × 4 × 4 array there are
4,096 entries), it can use vast amounts of computer memory.

(2) If **MKU**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by **UNIT**. It is the number of next
generation neutrons produced in **UNIT** J by a neutron born in
**UNIT** I. This matrix is used to calculate the matrix k-effective,
cofactor k-effectives and source vector by **UNIT**.

(3) If **MKH**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by the **HOLE** number. Matrix
information can be collected at either the highest **HOLE** nesting
level (first level of nesting) or the deepest **HOLE** nesting level.
**HHL**\ =YES specifies that the matrix information will be collected at
the first nesting level. By default, the matrix information is collected
at the deepest nesting level. The fission production matrix is the
number of next generation neutrons produced in **HOLE** J by a neutron
born in **HOLE** I. This matrix is used to calculate the matrix
k-effective, cofactor k-effectives and the source vector by **HOLE**.

(4) If **MKA**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fission
production matrix is collected by **ARRAY** number. It can be collected
at the highest **ARRAY** level (first level of nesting) or at the
deepest **ARRAY** level. **HAL**\ =YES specifies that the matrix
information will be collected at the first nesting level. By default,
the matrix information is collected at the deepest nesting level. The
fission production matrix is the number of next generation neutrons
produced in **ARRAY** J by a neutron born in **ARRAY** I. This matrix is
used to calculate the matrix k-effective, cofactor k-effectives and the
source vector by **ARRAY**.

The user can simultaneously implement all methods of calculating the
matrix k-effective. The results are labeled in the printout. Matrix
k-effectives cannot be calculated for a single unit problem. If the user
wishes to do so, the geometry description must have a cube or cuboid as
its outer region, and the problem description should include **READ
ARRAY END ARRAY**. These two actions convert the single unit problem
into a 1 × 1 × 1 array.

A cofactor k-effective is the eigenvalue of the fission production
matrix reduced by the row and column that references the specified
**UNIT** or position index. The difference between the k-effective for
the system and the cofactor k-effective for a **UNIT** or position index
is an indication of the *in situ* k-effective of that **UNIT** or the
contribution that **UNIT** makes to the k-effective of the system. The
cofactor k‑effective of a **UNIT** devoid of fissile material should
approximate the k-effective of the system.

Deviations
~~~~~~~~~~


When a deviation is calculated by KENO, it is the standard deviation of
the mean. This assumes a large sample having a normal distribution.
KENO calculates the real variance using an iterative approach and lag
covariance data between generations as follows :cite:`demaret_accurate_1999,becker_proof_2009`

1. The sample variance and covariance estimates are calculated.

2. The apparent variance is set equal to the sample variance and the
   apparent covariance is set equal to the sample covariance.

3. The real covariance is set equal to the apparent covariance and the
   real variance is calculated.

4. Using the real variance and apparent covariance calculate the real
   covariance.

5. The real variance is recalculated.

6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the real variance converges within a
   preset tolerance.

The covariance estimates are only calculated for the previous
20 generations. A maximum of 50 iterations are allowed for the real
variance to converge.

.. _8-1-3-14:

Generation time and lifetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generation time and lifetime calculations use the average velocity.
The validity of these calculations is determined by how accurately the
average velocity represents the spectrum over the range of the energy
group. The lifetime and generation time calculated by KENO are not
kinetics parameters. The lifetime is the average life span of a neutron
(in seconds) from the time it is born until it is absorbed or leaks from
the system. The generation time is the average time (in seconds) between
successive neutron generations.

.. _8-1-3-15:

Energy of the Average Lethargy of Fission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The energy of the average lethargy of neutrons causing fission (*EALF*)
is a parameter calculated in KENO to characterize the neutron energy
spectrum or fastness of a system. The *EALF* is given in units of eV in
the KENO output. An *EALF* value that is high (> 100 keV) indicates that
most fissions in the system are being caused by fast neutrons, and an
*EALF* value that is low (< 1 eV) indicates that most fissions are
induced by thermal neutrons.

The *EALF* is calculated by determining the lethargy, :math:`u`, a
measure of how much neutron energy changes from its initial or birth
energy:

  :label: eq8-1-1

  u = ln\left( \frac{E_{0}}{E} \right),


where :math:`E` is the energy of the neutron colliding with a nucleus
and :math:`E_{0}` is the maximum possible energy of fission neutrons
(assumed in KENO to be 10 MeV). The average lethargy of all fission
events is calculated by weighting the lethargy for each collision by the
probability that the collision will create a fission event, and
averaging this quantity. Using a log-scale parameter like lethargy to
represent the fastness of systems is more convenient than directly
averaging the energy of neutrons causing fission both because of the
wide range of neutrons in a problem (potentially more than seven orders
of magnitude), and because fast neutrons that are slowing down lose
about the same fraction of their energy during each collision.

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-2

  EALF = E_{o}e^{- u_{\text{avg}}}


Equation :eq:`eq8-1-2` is then applied again to transform the average lethargy of
neutrons causing fission into a neutron energy that corresponds to the
average lethargy of neutrons causing fission (this is the *EALF*); this
transformation back to units of energy is done because energy has a much
more intuitive meaning than units of lethargy.

Description of Output
---------------------

This section contains a brief description and explanation of the KENO
output. Portions of the printout will not be printed for every problem.
Some printout is optional, as noted in this section. This section
provides representative samples of the output format. The actual data
contained in this section are not necessarily consistent with results
computed by the current version of KENO.

KENO offers an HTML output format including a series of files that can
be viewed in a standard web browser. The HTML formatted output offers
interactive output that is easy to read and navigate. Many of the tables
of data can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on
the heading of the column for which sorting is desired. Interactive
plotting of fluxes, fission production, absorption, and k-effective
values are also available within the HTML output through an applet
version of the Javapeño plotting package. In this section, the standard
text output description is followed by a description of the optional
HTML formatted output. The HTML formatted output can be deactivated by
entering HTM=NO in the parameter data section.

Program verification information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program verification information :numref:`fig8-1-97` is printed after the
header page. It lists the name of the program, the date the load module
was created, the library that contains the load module, the computer
code name from the configuration control table, and the revision number.
The job name, date, and time of execution are also printed. This
information may be used for quality assurance purposes.

.. _fig8-1-97:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig97.png
  :align: center
  :width: 500

  Sample program verification table.

The program verification information is the first page shown in the
KENO HTML output, after selecting KENO from the SCALE HTML index page.
This page can also be displayed by selecting the *Program Verification
Information* link under the *General Information* submenu and is shown
in :numref:`fig8-1-97`.

.. _8-1-4-2:

Tables of parameter data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first two tables printed by KENO list the numeric parameters and
logical parameters used in the problem. The user should always verify
that the parameter data block was entered as desired. An example of
numeric parameters table is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-98`. An example of the
:numref:`fig8-1-99`.

.. _fig8-1-98:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig98.svg
  :align: center
  :width: 1000

  Sample table of numeric parameter data.

.. _fig8-1-99:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig99.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Sample table of logical parameter data.


For the logical parameter data table, messages concerning the parameter
data may be printed at the bottom of the table. If the problem is being
restarted, the title of the parent case is printed at the bottom of the
table. If the restart title or messages are not printed, the bottom
section of the table is omitted.

.. _8-1-4-3:

Unprocessed geometry input data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This printout is optional and is usually used to locate code
difficulties, to show all the geometry input data when only part of it
is used in the problem, or to show the order in which units were
entered. It is considered debug information and is printed only if
**PGM**\ =YES is specified in the parameter input data. Standard KENO
use does not require printing these data because the processed geometry
that is used in the problem is always printed. See :ref:`8-1-4-52-9` and
:ref:`8-1-4-13`. for examples of the standard printed KENO geometry data.

When the unprocessed geometry input is printed, the problem title is
located at the top of the page, followed by the heading “GEOMETRY
DESCRIPTION INPUT.” The region-dependent geometry information is then
printed. If the problem contains a unit orientation array, the problem
title is printed again, followed by the unit orientation. This is
followed by a statement affirming the completion of the data input.

.. _8-1-4-4:

Table of data sets used in the problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table is the third table of data printed by KENO. It should be
carefully scrutinized to verify the desired data set name is associated
with the proper unit number and volume. An example of this table is
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-100`.

.. _fig8-1-100:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig100.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Sample table of data sets used in the problem.


This table lists unit numbers specified in the parameter data or that
are defaulted in the code, along with the information pertinent to them.
This information is given in the following order, left to right: (1) the
keyword used in the parameter data to define the unit number, (2) the
unit number, (3) the data set name, (4) the name of the volume on which
the data set resides, and (5) the type of data contained on the data
set. This table can be useful for quality assurance purposes.
Information for units for which default values have not been overridden
is printed even though they may not be used in the problem. Information
for every unit specified in the parameter data is also printed. Units 8
and 10 are the direct-access devices, and their unit numbers are fixed
within the code. When this table is printed, Unit 10 has not yet been
defined. This causes its data set names to be listed as FT10F001 or as
“UNKNOWN” on some systems. If KENO is run as part of a CSAS sequence,
this table will include two entries for Unit 95: one for binary input
data, and one for read restart data.

.. _8-1-4-5:

Table of additional information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fourth table of data printed by KENO contains additional information
determined from the input data. An example of this table is shown in
:numref:fig8-1-101.

This table should be used to verify the problem input. The NUMBER OF
ENERGY GROUPS for a multigroup problem is read either from the
Monte Carlo formatted library, identified by the keyword **XSC** and the
unit function name MIXED CROSS SECTIONS from the Table of Data Sets in
:ref:`8-1-4-4`, or from the restart unit, identified by the keyword
**RST** and the unit function name, READ RESTART DATA. The NO. OF
FISSION SPECTRUM SOURCE GROUP is the number of different energy groups
for which a fission spectrum is defined. In the present version, this
number should always be 1. The NO. OF SCATTERING ANGLES IN XSECS is the
number of scattering angles to be used in processing the cross sections.
The default value is one, and it may be overridden by specifying the
parameter **SCT**\ = in the mixing table input. One scattering angle
yields P\ :sub:`1` cross sections, two scattering angles yield
P\ :sub:`3` cross sections, three scattering angles yield P\ :sub:`5`
cross sections, etc. ENTRIES/NEUTRON IN THE NEUTRON BANK specifies the
number of pieces of data that are banked for each history during
tracking. ENTRIES/NEUTRON IN THE FISSION BANK is the amount of data
stored for each source neutron for each generation.

.. _fig8-1-101:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig101.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Sample table of additional information.


The NUMBER OF MIXTURES USED is the number of different mixtures (media)
used in the geometry data used by the problem. This may be less than the
total number of different mixtures specified in the geometry data if
portions of the geometry data are not used in the problem.

The NUMBER OF BIAS IDS USED is the number of different biasing regions
used in the problem. This will always be one unless a biasing data block
is entered.

The NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL ALBEDOS USED is the number of different
differential albedo reflectors used in the problem. This will always be
zero unless the boundary condition data specify the use of differential
albedo reflection on one or more faces of the system as described in
:ref:`8-1-4-7`. The BOUNDARY CONDITION data printed in this table should
also be checked. The number of different differential albedos specified
on the faces should be consistent with the NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL
ALBEDOS USED. Specular, mirror, vacuum, and periodic are not
differential albedos. Several different keywords may be used to specify
the same differential albedo.

The TOTAL INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS is the number of geometry regions
specified in the problem input. This excludes UNIT label and comments
provided using COM=, but it includes the array boundary description.
It excludes the automatic reflector description, but it includes the
geometry regions generated by it. The NUMBER OF GEOMETRY REGIONS USED is
the number of geometry regions used in the problem. It may be less than
or equal to the TOTAL INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS. The LARGEST GEOMETRY UNIT
NUMBER is the largest unit number defined in the geometry data,
including unused units and implicitly defined units. Implicitly defined
unit numbers are created when a core boundary specification is not
immediately preceded by a specification. The unit number is assigned by
the code by adding one to the largest unit number encountered in the
geometry region data. For example, if two such core boundary
specifications are contained in a problem whose largest explicitly
defined unit number is 7, then a unit number of 8 is assigned to the
first one, and a unit number of 9 is assigned to the second one. A value
of 9 would be printed for the LARGEST GEOMETRY UNIT NUMBER. The LARGEST
ARRAY NUMBER is the largest array number specified in the array data.

USE LATTICE GEOMETRY is determined by the logical flag that indicates
whether or not the problem is a single unit problem. This should be YES
for any problem that is not a single unit problem and NO for a single
unit problem. By definition, a single unit problem does not use array
data in any form. :ref:`8-1-4-12` describes array data. The GLOBAL
ARRAY NUMBER is the number of the array designated as the global,
overall, or universal array. The global array can be thought of as the
array that defines the overall system.

The NUMBER OF UNITS IN THE GLOBAL X/Y/Z DIR. defines the size of the
global array in terms of the number of units that are located along the
edge of the array boundaries in the X/Y/Z directions. For a single unit,
all three of these should be zero. For a simple 1 × 1 × 1 array
consisting of one unit type, all three of these numbers should be 1.

USE GLOBAL REFLECTOR indicates if the global array is reflected.

USE NESTED HOLES is set YES if holes are nested deeper than one level.

NUMBER OF HOLES is the number of HOLES that are entered in the geometry
region data.

The MAXIMUM HOLE NESTING LEVEL is the deepest level of hole nesting.

USE NESTED ARRAYS is set YES if arrays are nested deeper than one level.

The NUMBER OF ARRAYS USED is the number of array descriptions actually
used in the problem description.

MAXIMUM ARRAY NESTING LEVEL is the deepest level of array nesting.

Six BOUNDARY CONDITIONs are printed near the bottom of the table. They
show the type of boundary condition that is applied to each face of the
system. These should all be VACUUM unless albedo boundary conditions are
applied to one or more faces of the system. One should refer to the
NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIAL ALBEDOS USED, as discussed previously in the
description of this table of information.

.. _8-1-4-6:

Mixing table data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If **LIB=** is entered in the KENO parameter data and a mixing table
data block is provided to KENO, mixing table data will be printed. This
output edit is not considered optional because it cannot be suppressed
if the necessary data are present. Sample mixing table data are shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-102` In the HTML output, the mixing table data can be accessed
with the *Mixing Table* link in the *Input Data* section.

The data printed in this table include the problem title, the number of
scattering angles, and the cross section message threshold. Data are
then printed for each mixture. First the mixture number, density, and
temperature are printed, followed by a table of the nuclides which make
up the mixture. This table contains the following data: nuclide
ID number, nuclide mixture ID number, atom density, weight fraction of
nuclide in mixture, ZA number, atomic weight, temperature, and nuclide
title. Mixture temperature is the same as the nuclides’ temperatures for
the multigroup calculations, but it may be different for the continuous
energy calculations if Doppler broadening is not enabled since the
nuclides are loaded from libraries with the closest temperature. After
all mixture data have been printed, a table of nuclides and descriptive
titles is printed for all nuclides included in the mixtures. If extra
1-D cross sections were specified in the problem (see **X1D**\ =,
:ref:`8-1-2-3`), the extra 1-D cross section IDs will be printed under
the heading “1-D CROSS SECTION ARRAY ID NUMBERS.” If is to be calculated
(parameter **NUB**\ =YES), six MT numbers will be printed. The MT number
for the total cross section (Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 1; the MT number for the sum
of the transfer array normalized byΣ\ :sub:`T` is 2002; the MT number
for the normalized fission-product cross section (νΣ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`t`)
is 1452; the MT number for the normalized absorption cross section
(Σ\ :sub:`abs`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 27; the MT number for the normalized fission
cross section (Σ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`) is 18; and the MT number for the
fission spectrum (χ) is 1018. χ is summed and normalized to 1.0. Other
MT numbers in this list have been specified by the user. If the number
of blocks on the direct access data set are insufficient to hold the
cross section data, a message is printed stating THE NUMBER OF DIRECT
ACCESS BLOCKS ON UNIT____\_ HAS BEEN INCREASED TO \____. If the problem
is to write a restart data set (parameter **RES**\ =), a message is
printed stating that restart information was written, and the restart
I/O unit number is specified. This is followed by a statement of the
number of I/Os used in preparing the cross sections. The user should
examine the mixing table carefully to verify that the proper nuclides
are specified for the proper mixtures and that all the data are correct.
The mixing table is printed in subroutine PRTMIX.

.. _8-1-4-7:

Albedo cross section correspondence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the albedo cross section correspondence tables is optional. The
headings for the tables are printed in subroutine CORRE, and then
subroutine RATIO prints the data. These tables are printed only if
**PAX**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data as described in
:ref:`8-1-2-3`. Examples of these tables are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-103` and
:numref:`fig8-1-104`.

The table shown in :numref:`fig8-1-103` contains, left to right, the cross
section energy group, the lower and upper lethargy bounds, the
corresponding albedo energy groups, and the cumulative probability
associated with each albedo energy group for choosing the albedo energy
group corresponding to the cross section energy group. The table shown
in :numref:`fig8-1-104` is the inverse of the table shown in :numref:`fig8-1-103`. It
provides the cumulative probabilities for choosing the cross section
energy group corresponding to the albedo energy group. The information
in these tables is automatically generated by KENO.

.. _fig8-1-103:

.. _8-1-4-8:

1-D macroscopic cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decision to print the 1-D mixture cross sections is optional. They
are printed only if **XS1**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data.
When the 1-D cross sections are to be printed, they are printed a group
at a time for each mixture. The 1-D mixture cross sections for a mixture
are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-105`.

.. _fig8-1-105:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig105.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of macroscopic 1-D cross sections.

When the 1-D mixture cross sections are printed, the problem title is
printed at the top of the page. The mixture ID, mixture index, and
mixture number are then printed. ID is the mixture number from the
mixing table, and mixture index is the index used to reference it and
mixture number is its identifier. This step is followed by a heading to
identify the different 1-D cross sections. *GROUP* is the energy group,
*sigt* is the total cross section for the mixture, *sigs* is the
nonabsorption probability, *siga* is the absorption probability, *signu*
is the production probability, *chi* is the fission spectrum, *mwa1* is
the pointer for the first position of the cross sections for the energy
group, *mwa2* is the pointer for the last position of the cross sections
for the energy group, and *mwa3* contains the group for the transfer
corresponding to the first position. *SUM* is the sum of the absorption
probability and the nonabsorption probability. The absorption
probability is defined as the absorption cross section divided by the
total cross section. The nonabsorption probability is the sum of the
group-to-group transfers for this group, divided by the total
cross section. The production probability is defined as the fission
production cross section divided by the total cross section
(νΣ\ :sub:`f`/ Σ\ :sub:`T`). The nonabsorption probability and the production
probability are not true probabilities in that they may be greater than
1. This is because the nonabsorption probability has the (n,2n) transfer
array summed into the total transfer array twice, and the (n,3n) is
summed three times, etc.

.. _8-1-4-9:

Extra 1-d cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the extra 1-D cross sections is optional. They are printed if
**P1D**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data. Extra 1-D
cross sections are not used in KENO unless **NUB**\ =YES is specified in
the parameter data or the user has altered the code to access and
utilize other 1-D cross sections. If \ **NUB**\ =YES is specified, the
extra 1-D cross section is the fission cross section, which is used to
calculate the average number of neutrons per fission. This is printed
only for fissile mixtures as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-105`. The fission cross
section heading follows the table of 1‑D cross sections. The fission
cross section heading is XSEC ID 18, and it follows the table of 1-D
cross sections.

.. _8-1-4-10:

2-D macroscopic cross sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The decision to print the 2-D mixture cross sections is optional. They
are printed only if **XS2**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data.
They are printed after the 1-D cross sections for the mixture. A
heading is printed, followed by the transfer data. An example of the
2-D mixture cross sections is given in :numref:`fig8-1-106`.

.. _fig8-1-106:

  Example of 2-D macroscopic cross sections.




.. _8-1-4-11:

Probabilities and angles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the probabilities and angles is optional. They are printed if
the number of scattering angles is greater than zero and **XAP**\ =YES
is specified in the parameter data. Examples of the probabilities are
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-107`. Examples of the angles are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-108`. If the group-to-group
transfer for a mixture is isotropic, the first angle for that transfer
will be set to −2.0 as a flag to the code.

.. _8-1-4-12:

Array summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The arrays that are used in the problem are summarized in the table
shown in :numref:`fig8-1-109`. This table is printed whenever more than one array is used in
the problem.

.. _fig8-1-109:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig109.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of array summary.


The ARRAY NUMBER is the number by which the array is designated in the
input data. The number of units in the X, Y, and Z directions is listed
for each array. The NESTING LEVEL indicates the level of nesting for
each array. The global, overall, or universe array is flagged by the
word GLOBAL. The global array should always appear at the first nesting
level. Arrays that have been placed in the global reflector by using
holes should also appear at the first nesting level. A nesting level of
one is the highest or first nesting levels. The larger the number in the
nesting level column, the deeper the nesting level will be.

.. _8-1-4-13:

Geometry data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The geometry region data used by the problem are always printed and
cannot be suppressed. They should be carefully examined by the user to
verify the mixture number, bias ID, and geometry specifications used in
the problem. If geometry region data are entered but are not referenced
in the unit orientation array data, they will not be printed here. An
example would be to enter geometry region data describing Units 1, 2, 3,
and 4 and to use only Units 1, 3, and 4 in the unit orientation array.
Then the geometry region data for Unit 2 will not be printed. An example
of the KENO V.a geometry region printout for a problem is given in
:numref:`fig8-1-110`.

The problem title and a heading are printed at the top of each page.
REGION is the region number within a unit. Each unit has its regions
numbered sequentially, beginning with one. MEDIA NUM is the mixture
number or mixture ID that occupies the volume defined by the region.
BIAS ID is the bias ID that corresponds to the desired set of weight
average for biasing the region. The unit number is printed at the top of
each unit’s geometry region description near the center of the page. The
data printed for each geometry region include (1) the region number
relative to the unit (numbered sequentially within the unit), (2) the
shape of the geometry region, (3) the mixture ID of the material within
the volume defined by the region, (4) the bias ID to define the average
weight of a neutron in the region, and (5) the dimensions defining the
outer boundaries of the geometry region. If additional geometry
surrounds an array, a heading is printed stating: UNIT \___\_ EXTERNAL
TO LATTICE \____. The lattice number is the number of the array that is
surrounded by the specified geometry. The unit number is the unit that
contains the specified geometry. In the case of an external reflector
for the global array, the unit number is assigned by the code.

.. _fig8-1-110:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig110.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of geometry region data.


.. _8-1-4-14:

Unit orientation description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each unit orientation description defines the location of units in the
3-D lattice that represent the specified array. The array described is
identified in the heading UNIT ORIENTATION DESCRIPTION FOR ARRAY \____.
The arrays used in the problem are stacked together to represent the
physical problem being analyzed. The unit orientation description is not
printed if only Unit 1 is described in the problem. The user should
carefully examine the unit orientation descriptions to ensure proper
placement of the units in each lattice. A sample unit orientation
description is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-111` .

.. _fig8-1-111:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig111.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of unit orientation description.


If a very large array is used by the problem, its unit orientation
description may be spread over several pages. When checking the
printout, the user should pay careful attention to the headings that
indicate the portion of each lattice being printed. The detailed
printout of an array may be suppressed using the ARRAY parameter PRT=no.

.. _8-1-4-15:

Volume information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The volume information printout differs between KENO V.a and KENO-VI.
Because it does not allow intersections of bodies, KENO V.a is always
able to calculate analytically the volume of any region in the geometry.
KENO-VI, on the other hand, never calculates volumes analytically. In
fact, KENO-VI never calculates volumes unless it is directed to do so,
but it can read volumes off the **MEDIA** cards or off a **VOLUME** file
(:ref:`8-1-2-13`).

.. _8-1-4-15-1:

KENO V.a
^^^^^^^^

Three tables of volumes are always printed and cannot be suppressed. The
problem title is printed at the top of the page, followed by the heading
“VOLUMES FOR THOSE UNITS UTILIZED IN THIS PROBLEM.” An example of the
volume printout is given in .

The first table is arranged by ascending unit number. It includes
(1) the unit number, (2) the region number within the unit, (3) the
overall geometry region number, (4) the net volume of each individual
region, and (5) the cumulative volume through each region in the unit.
The cumulative volume of the last region in a unit is the total volume
of the unit. The unit number is printed under the heading UNIT. Data
listed under the heading REGION refer to the number of the geometry
region within the unit. The geometry regions within a unit are numbered
sequentially starting with 1. Data entered under the heading GEOMETRY
REGION refer to the entry number of the individual geometry region.
These are numbered sequentially, starting with 1, through the TOTAL
INPUT GEOMETRY REGIONS defined in :numref:`fig8-1-112`. The net volume of each individual
region is calculated by subtracting the volume of the interior region
from the volume of the region and is listed under the heading VOLUME.
The data listed under the heading CUMULATIVE VOLUME are calculated from
the dimensions of the region. A simple example demonstrating how volumes
are calculated can be given by assuming a unit that is composed of three
concentric cubes. Region 1 is a cube 3 cm on a side, region 2 is a cube
4 cm on a side, and region 3 is a cube 5 cm on a side. The cumulative
volume of region 1 is 27 cm\ :sup:`3` (3\ :sup:`3`); the cumulative volume
of region 2 is 64 cm\ :sup:`3` (4\ :sup:`3`); the cumulative volume of
region 3 is 125 cm\ :sup:`3` (5\ :sup:`3`). The volume of region 1 is
27 cm\ :sup:`3` (3\ :sup:`3`), the volume of region 2 is 37 cm\ :sup:`3`
(64 - 27), and the volume of region 3 is 61 cm\ :sup:`3` (125 - 64).

.. _fig8-1-112:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig112.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Sample volume information.


The second table contains (1) the unit number, (2) the number of times
the unit is used in the problem, (3) the region number within the unit,
(4) the mixture number present in the region, and (5) the total volume
associated with the region in the whole problem. The unit number is
printed under the heading UNIT, data printed under the heading USES
indicates the number of times the unit is used in the problem. Data
printed under the heading MIXTURE indicates the mixture number used in
the region. The total volume of each region is printed under the heading
TOTAL VOLUME and is determined by multiplying the VOLUME of the region
listed in the first table by the number of times the unit containing
that region is used in the problem.

The third table is printed following the heading “TOTAL MIXTURE
VOLUMES.” In this table, the mixtures used in the problem are listed
with their associated total volume and total mass. The mixture numbers
are printed under the heading MIXTURE, the total volume of each mixture
is printed under the heading TOTAL VOLUME, and the mass of each mixture
is printed under the heading MASS(G). All masses will be printed as zero
if the working format cross section library does not contain the data
required to calculate the densities of the mixtures used in the problem.

.. _8-1-4-15-2:

KENO-VI
^^^^^^^

Two tables of volumes are printed by subroutine VOLUME and cannot be
suppressed. If a volume calculation type of NONE is specified and no
volumes are read in for the regions, then the volumes will be set to
−1.0, which will result in negative fluxes and fission densities. For
the calculated volumes, an error estimate is printed after the volumes.
The first table will list the number of times each unit is used in the
problem and the total volume of each region throughout the entire
problem description. The second table will list the total volume and
mass of each mixture used in the problem. An example of the volume

  Sample volume information.


The unit number is printed under the heading **UNIT**. The REGION refers
to the number of the geometry region within the unit determined by the
order of the CONTENT records in the unit. USES indicates the number of
times the unit is used in the problem. MIXTURE is the mixture number
used in the region. A blank indicates an array or unit, placed in a
hole, in that region. TOTAL VOLUME is the total volume of that region
followed by +/− and an error estimate if the volume for the region was
calculated.

If mesh volumes are used, there will be a table listing the cumulative
volumes generated by summing the mesh volumes, the deviations, and the
deltas between the summed volumes and the overall volumes for the
regions. If the overall volume has been calculated, then the delta
should be zero, but if it was entered, then the delta will show the
difference.

In the last table, the mixtures used in the problem are listed along
with their total volumes and masses. Along with the total volumes and
masses, an error estimate is printed for any mixtures having regions
that were calculated using either the **RANDOM** or **TRACE** volume
estimates.

Mesh volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the mesh flux accumulator, fluxes are tabulated for each region of
each unit in a cuboidal mesh. KENO computes the volume of each region in
each mesh interval so that fluxes per unit volume can be determined. For
models where the mesh flux accumulator is activated by setting
**MFX**\ =YES and the mesh size set to a positive value with **MSH**\ =,
the cumulative volume of all mesh intervals for a given region and the
number of meshes used in each region are printed as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-114`.

  Sample sum of mesh volumes edit.


An optional edit of volumes for each mesh interval for each region can
be activated by entering **PMV**\ =YES in the parameter input. This edit
can be very large, especially if a small mesh size is used with a large
model. A sample of the volume by mesh for each region is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-115`.

Biasing information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This table specifies the weighting or biasing data to be used in the
problem. An example of biasing information is given in :numref:`fig8-1-116`.

  Biasing information.



The user is responsible for determining from the input data whether the
group-dependent weights (wtavg) for the specified material(s) were
obtained from the weighting library or were entered by the user. The
group-dependent weights can be printed for verification purposes as
shown in :ref:`8-1-4-18`.

.. _8-1-4-18:

Group-dependent weights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing the group-dependent weights is optional. They are printed if
**PWT**\ =YES is entered in the parameter data. An example of the
printed group-dependent weights is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-117`.

.. _fig8-1-117:

  Example of biasing data.


The title is printed at the top of the table. The average weight (wtavg)
is printed for each energy group and each BIAS ID. The BIAS ID number
printed at the top of the column corresponds to the BIAS ID used in the
geometry region description or MEDIA record and printed in the biasing
information.

.. _8-1-4-19:

Plot representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plots representing 2-D slices through the geometrical description of the
problem are optional. They are created if plot data are entered unless
**PLT**\ =NO is specified either in the plot data or the parameter data.
Plots can be generated and displayed as (1) character plots with
alphanumeric characters representing mixture numbers, unit numbers, or
bias ID numbers or (2) color plots with colors representing mixture
numbers, unit numbers, or bias ID numbers. Color plots generate a PNG
file and require an independent program to be displayed.

An example of the output generated using the character plot method is
given in :numref:`fig8-1-118` and :numref:`fig8-1-119`. An example of the output generated using the color plot
method is given in :numref:`fig8-1-120` and :numref:`fig8-1-121`.

:numref:`fig8-1-118` summarizes the data used to generate the character plot. :numref:`fig8-1-119` is an example
of a character plot of the 2-D slice specified through the geometrical
description of the problem. In :numref:`fig8-1-118`, the plot title is printed at the top of
the page, followed by a statement that “THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A
CHARACTER PLOT.” If a plot title was not entered in the plot data, the
plot title is defaulted to the problem title. The title is followed by a
heading specifying the type of plot (MIXTURE MAP, BIAS ID MAP, or UNIT
MAP). This is followed by a table that correlates the symbols to be used
in the character plot with the mixture numbers, bias ID numbers, or unit
numbers that were used in the problem. If the problem is a bare array,
the overall system coordinates are printed. Then the coordinates of the
upper left corner and lower right corner of the plot are printed. This
is followed by the direction cosines down and across the plot. The
remaining plot parameters (including both input data and calculated
values) are then printed. NU is the number of characters printed in the
U (down) direction, NV is the number of characters printed in the V
(across) direction, DELU is the incremental distance, in cm, represented
by each character in the U (down) direction, DELV is the incremental
distance, in cm, represented by each character in the V (across)
direction, and LPI is the vertical to horizontal scaling factor for plot
proportionality.

  Summary of character plot symbols, coordinates, and data.

:numref:`fig8-1-119` shows a character plot of a 2-D slice specified through the
geometrical description of the problem. These plots aid the user in
verifying that the problem is described correctly. Any number of plots
can be made in one problem.

:numref:`fig8-1-120` summarizes the data used to generate the color plot.
:numref:`fig8-1-121` is an example of a color plot of the 2-D slice specified
through the geometrical description of the problem. This plot does not
appear in the KENO printout. It is generated from a PNG file that is
created when a color plot has been specified in the KENO input data and
requires special processing by the user.

In :numref:`fig8-1-121`, the plot title is printed at the top of the page,
followed by a statement that “THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A COLOR PLOT.” If a
plot title was not entered in the plot data, the plot title is defaulted
to the problem title. The title is followed by a heading specifying the
type of plot (MIXTURE MAP, BIAD ID MAP, or UNIT MAP). If the problem is
a bare array, the overall system coordinates are printed. Then the
coordinates of the upper left corner and lower right corner of the plot
are printed. This is followed by the direction cosines down and across
the plot. The remaining plot parameters (including both input data and
calculated values) are then printed. NU is the number of characters
printed in the U (down) direction, NV is the number of characters
printed in the V (across) direction, DELU is the incremental distance,

Initial source and final pretracking edits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to calculating the *k\ eff* values for each generation, KENO
prints the number of I/Os used before tracking and the number of minutes
used processing the data. If the problem is not a restart problem,
initial source information follows those two lines as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-122` (KENO V.a
example).

The VOLUME FRACTION OF FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE CORE is the first line of
data printed. If \ **RFL**\ =YES was specified in the start data, the
volume fraction message is changed to VOLUME FRACTION OF FISSILE
MATERIAL IN THE SYSTEM. This is followed by the start type, other data
used to generate the initial source distribution, and finally, the
amount of time used to generate the initial source distribution and the
total elapsed time. :numref:`fig8-1-122` illustrates starting information printed for start
type 0. The cuboid for choosing starting points is (1) the array
boundary for either a bare array or a reflected array with the key to
start in the reflector turned off (**RFL**\ =NO), (2) the overall system
for a reflected array if the key to start in the reflector is turned on
(**RFL**\ =YES) and the outer region is a cuboid, or (3) a cuboid
specified by the user via the keywords **XSM**\ =, **XSP**\ =,
**YSM**\ =, **YSP**\ =, **ZSM**\ =, and **ZSP**\ =. For each start type
for which the reflector key, **RFL**\ = is applicable, a statement is
printed stating that “the flag to start neutrons in the reflector is
turned ‘on’ or ‘off.’”

:numref:`fig8-1-122` illustrates typical starting data for start type 0 (a flat start in
fissile material). In this example, the starting cuboid is the core
boundary of a bare array. The default value of **RFL** was not
overridden. The parameter used in this example was **NST**\ =0.

Reference center for flux moment/angular flux transform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When **TFM**\ =YES is entered, the flux moments and angular fluxes are
computed in a transformed coordinate system, relative to a “reference
center” point. The default position for the reference center is the
center of all fueled regions in the model. However, the center can be
specified by the user for each region defined in the system model using
the “center” modifier on a region input card. Edits of the fuel center
and the position of the reference center for each region are shown when
**TFM**\ =YES as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-123`.

Print starting points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This printout is optional and is used to verify the initial source
starting points. This option is activated by specifying the parameter
**PSP**\ =YES. Examples of this information are given in :numref:`fig8-1-124` and
:numref:`fig8-1-125`.

The information pertinent to the initial source distribution is printed
two lines at a time and appears under the designated headings. For
example, the coordinates X, Y, and Z are printed on one line and the
direction cosines U, V, and W are printed directly under them. The data
printed for each source neutron include the following:

NEUTRON
  is the ID number of the neutron.

X, Y, and Z
  are the coordinates of the starting point relative to the
  coordinate system of the unit.

K
  is the region number that contains the point X, Y, Z.

ETAUSD
  is the amount of the distance to collision already traversed
  (KENO-VI edit).

NOW
  is the array number.

NBX, NBY, NBZ
  are the coordinates of the unit within the array.

LSTC
  is the last unit where the neutron resided (KENO-VI edit).

NHOL
  is the hole where the neutron currently resides (KENO-VI edit).

LL
  is the unit number located at NBX, NBY, NBZ.

KR
  is the mixture number present at the starting point.

KI
  is the bias ID number or importance region at the starting point.

WT
  is the current weight (WT is always 1.0 for a neutron when it is
  started).

U, V, and W
  are the direction cosines defining the direction the history
  is traveling.

IG
  is the energy group.

KCOR
  is the region in the unit that contains the array where the
  neutron is located.

K1
  is the region number of the first region in unit LL.

K2
  is the region number of the last region in unit LL.

IGEO
  is an integer that defines the geometry shape of the region.

KCOL
  is the region number in which the last collision occurred.

NSIG
  is the position of the group IG in the supergroup.

SG
  is the supergroup number.

RANDOM NUMBER
  is the current random number.

When starting points are printed, many of the above named variables have
not been initialized. For starting, the variables of interest are X, Y,
Z, U, V, W, NBX, NBY, NBZ, and LL.

K-effectives by generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the completion of each generation, KENO prints the *k\ eff* for that
generation and associated information. An example of this printout is
given in :numref:`fig8-1-126`.

.. _fig8-1-126:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig126.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of k-effectives and source entropy by generation.


The data printed include (1) the generation number, (2) the k-effective
calculated for the generation, (3) the average value of k-effective
through the current generation (excluding the *nskip-1* generations),
(4) the deviation associated with the average k-effective, (5) Shannon
entropy for the generation, (6) the matrix k-effective for the
generation, and (7) the deviation associated with the matrix
k-effective. Column 5 is omitted if the user disabled source convergence
diagnostics. The last two columns are filled with zeros if the user did
not specify matrix k-effective calculations. The matrix k‑effective is
the largest eigenvalue of the fission production matrix. Matrix
information can be calculated based on (1) position index, (2) unit
number, (3) hole number, and (4) array number. The matrix k‑effective
printed in the sixth column is based on this order. If the matrix
k-effective is calculated by position index, it is the one printed in
the sixth column. The matrix k-effective by unit number is given second
preference, followed by hole number and then array number.

After the last generation, a message is printed to indicate why
execution was terminated. If matrix k‑effectives were calculated, this
is followed by a message stating the method used to determine the matrix
k-effective.

The user should examine this portion of the printed results to ensure
that the two methods of calculating k-effective are in acceptable
agreement and to verify that the average value of k-effective has become
relatively stable. If the k-effectives appear to be oscillating or
drifting significantly, then the user should consider rerunning the
problem with a larger number of histories per generation.

If a problem is restarted, then the generation numbers and k-effectives
are printed and the words FROM RESTART UNIT are printed in the elapsed
time column. All other columns are blank. When the generation at which
the problem is to be restarted is reached, the print reverts to the
normal format as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-126`.

.. _8-1-4-24:

Problem characterization edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The problem characterization edit follows the k-effective by generation
edit. The title is printed at the top of the page, followed by the
lifetime and the generation time and their associated deviations. The
lifetime is the average lifespan of a neutron (in seconds) from the time
it is born until it is absorbed or leaks from the system. The generation
time is the average time (in seconds) between successive neutron
generations. If **NUB**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data,
(:ref:`8-1-2-3`) the average number of neutrons per fission, NU BAR, and
its associated deviation are printed and the AVERAGE FISSION GROUP
(the average energy group at which fission occurs) and its associated
deviation are printed. Then the ENERGY(EV) OF THE AVERAGE LETHARGY OF
NEUTRONS CAUSING FISSION and its associated deviation are printed,
followed by the system mean free path. If **SMU**\ =YES is specified in
the parameter data, the average self-multiplication of a unit and its
associated deviation is printed. This self-multiplication results from
fissions caused by neutrons born in the unit. Fissions caused by
neutrons that exit the unit and return are not included. The problem
characterization edit is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-127`.

.. _8-1-4-25:

Final k-effective edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final k-effective edit prints the average k-effective and its
associated deviation and the limits of
k-effective for the 67, 95, and 99% confidence intervals. The number
of histories used in calculating the average k-effective is also
printed. This is done skipping various numbers of generations. The
user should carefully examine the final k-effective edit to determine
if the average k-effective is relatively stable. If a noticeable drift
is apparent as the number of initial generations skipped increases, it
may indicate a problem in converging the source. If this appears to be
the case, the problem should be rerun with a better initial source
distribution and should be run for a sufficient number of generations
that the average k‑effective becomes stable. Then the final
k-effective edit is printed as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-128`.

.. _fig8-1-128:

  Example of the final k-effective edit.

.. _8-1-4-26:

Plot of average k-effective by generation run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plot consists of average k-effectives plotted versus the number of
generations run. The limits of one standard deviation are plotted on
either side of each average k-effective. These average k-effectives are
not necessarily the same as the average k-effectives described in
:ref:`8-1-4-23`. The code omits the k‑effectives of the first *nskip*
generations when the average k-effectives for this plot are calculated.
Although the k-effective of the *nskip* generation is summed into the
average k-effective, it is not plotted because standard deviations
cannot be calculated for a single point. Thus, if *nskip* is 3 (i.e.,
the first three generations are skipped), the first value plotted is the
average k-effective corresponding to the fifth generation. The dotted
line represents the value of the average k-effective corresponding to
the smallest deviation when the average k-effective and its deviation
are computed for each generation over the range of *nskip* through the
total number of generations.

:numref:`fig8-1-129` is an example of this type of plot in the text output. The
primary use for this plot is to determine if the problem has source
convergence difficulties.

Plot of average k-effective by generations skipped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plot illustrates the average k-effective versus the number of
generations skipped as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-130`. The limits of one standard
deviation are plotted on either side of the average k-effective. The
dotted line represents the value of the average k-effective
corresponding to the smallest deviation when the average k-effective and
its deviation are computed for the number of generations skipped over
the range of *nskip*\ +1 through :sup:`2`/:sub:`3` the total number of
generations calculated. The plot is essentially a plot of the data
described in :ref:`8-1-4-25`. It is useful for determining if source
convergence has been achieved.

Final edit of fissions, absorptions, and leakage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final edit of fissions, absorptions, and leakage follows the final
k-effective edit and includes the fission fraction for each group and
the fission production, absorptions, and leakage, each with its
associated percent deviation. Examples of the final edits of fissions,
absorptions, and leakage are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-131`\ –\ :numref:`fig8-1-133`.

If **FAR**\ =NO is specified, region-dependent fissions and absorptions
are not printed. :numref:`fig8-1-131` demonstrates the printout if **FAR**\ =NO.

.. _fig8-1-131:

  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Sample of the final edit of fissions, absorptions, and leakage and the region-dependent totals with print by region suppressed.

If **FAR**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data, the fissions and
absorptions for each geometry region used in the problem are calculated
for each energy group. Leakage is not collected by geometry region, but
rather it represents the leakage from the system. GROUP is the energy
group number; FISSION FRACTION is the fraction of the fissions that
occur in that energy group. The percent deviation for the fission
fraction is the same as that of the fissions in the same group. The
heading **UNIT** refers to the unit, and REGION is the region number
within the specified unit. The geometry regions are numbered
sequentially within each unit, starting with 1. The sum of the fissions
for every region for a given energy group is the total printed for that
energy group. The same is true of absorptions. The fissions,
absorptions, and leakages are given in units of per source neutron. The
SYSTEM TOTAL is the sum over all the energy groups of the fissions,
absorptions, and leakage. The associated percent deviation is printed
for each.

The parameter **GAS** is used to control printing of fission productions
and absorptions for each geometry region by energy group as shown in
:numref:`fig8-1-131`. **GAS**\ =YES causes this data to be printed, provided
**FAR**\ =YES is also specified. **GAS**\ =NO turns off this print by
group as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-133`.

The sum of the leakage and absorptions printed for the system total
should be close to 1. The fissions printed for the system total should
be the same as the first k-effective printed in the final k-effective
edit described in :ref:`8-1-4-25`. If differential albedos are used, the
leakage does not include the weight lost in the albedo reflection. A
message stating the weight lost in the albedo is printed. This is the
weight lost due to absorptions in the albedo reflector and leakage from
the albedo reflector. No leakage is associated with faces having
specular, mirror image, or periodic reflection. Thus there is no leakage
associated with an infinite problem. The total elapsed time and final
random number are printed at the end of this edit.

.. _8-1-4-29:

Reaction tally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reaction tally calculations are performed if the required data is
specified in the reaction data block (:ref:`8-1-2-15`). KENO prints a
table in the output that summarizes the parameter specifications in
reaction tally calculations. An example of the parameter table for the
reaction tally calculations are is in :numref:`fig8-1-134`.

Source convergence diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

KENO calculates the Shannon entropy of the fission source distribution
at each generation and reports this in the problem output
(:ref:`8-1-4-23`). At the end of calculation, KENO performs three tests
to check the fission source convergence and reports these test results
in the output. (See :ref:`8-1-6-7` for the definition of these tests.) An
example of the fission source convergence diagnostics is given in
:numref:`fig8-1-135`.

Matrix k-effective by position index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The matrix k-effective by unit location (also referred to as array
position or position index) is calculated if **MKP**\ =YES is specified
in the parameter data and a global array is present in the model. It is
the largest eigenvalue of the fission production matrix collected by
position index. :ref:`8-1-3-12` provides a complete discussion of
matrix k-effective. The POSITION INDEX is a number referencing a
position in a 3-D lattice. POSITION is the X, Y, and Z location within
the lattice. **UNIT** is the unit located at the specified location in
the lattice. Thus, in :numref:`fig8-1-139` , **UNIT** 1 is located at the lower left-hand
front corner of the array or 3-D lattice representing the problem (X=1,
Y=1, Z=1) and the corresponding POSITION INDEX is 1. POSITION INDEX 8 is
the top right-hand back corner of the lattice, POSITION X=2, Y=2, Z=2
and the unit located at that position is **UNIT** 8. An example of the
matrix k‑effective by position is given in numref:`fig8-1-136` . The text output is
contained within two rows of asterisks to draw attention to it.

Fission production by position index matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain fission production by position information, the user must
specify **MKP**\ =YES and **FMP**\ =YES in the parameter data. The
number of entries in the fission production matrix by position index is
the square of the array size. Thus for a 2 × 2 × 2 array there are
64 entries, and for a 4 × 4 × 4 array there are 4,096 entries in the
fission production matrix by position index. An example of the fission
production matrix by position index for a 2 × 2 × 2 array is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-137`.

.. _fig8-1-137:

  Sample fission production matrix by position index.

For each position index in the array, the number of next-generation neutrons
produced at position index J per neutron born at position index I is determined.
The fission production matrix by position index is used to determine the matrix
k-effective, cofactor k-effective and source vector by position index.

.. _8-1-4-33:

Source vector by position index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source vector by position index information is printed if **MKP**\ =YES
is specified in the parameter data. The source vector by position index
is the eigenvector of the fission production matrix by position index
and should sum to 1.0. It represents the fission source for the
specified locations in the 3-D lattice representing the physical problem
being analyzed. Position zero contains all material outside the global
array. An example of the source vector by position index is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-138`.
The average self-multiplication by array position is the overall average

Cofactor k-effective by position index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cofactor k-effective by position index edit is printed if
**MKP**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data. This means that the
fission production matrix is collected by position index. Calculating
and printing cofactor k-effectives by position index can be avoided by
specifying **CKP**\ =NO in the parameter data. An example of the
cofactor k-effective by position index is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-139`. See
KENO Appendix C for a description of the problem used for the example.

.. _fig8-1-139:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig139.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Example of cofactor k-effective by position index.

The cofactor k-effective for a given position index is the largest
eigenvalue of the fission production matrix collected by position index,
reduced by the row and column associated with that position index. Thus
the cofactor k-effective is the value of k-effective for the system
calculated without the fission source of the unit located at the
specified position index.

.. _8-1-4-35:

Matrix k-effective by unit number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The matrix k-effective by unit number (unit k-effective) is the largest
eigenvalue of the fission production by unit matrix. It is calculated
only if **MKU**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data. An example of
the matrix k-effective by unit is given in :numref:`fig8-1-140`.

Fission production by unit number matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fission production by unit number matrix is computed and printed if
**MKU**\ =YES and **FMU**\ =YES are specified in the parameter data.
Thus, for each unit in the array, the number of next-generation neutrons
produced in Unit J per neutron born in Unit I is determined. This is the
fission production matrix by unit, and it is used to determine the
matrix k-effective by unit, the cofactor k-effective by unit, and the
source vector by unit. An example of the fission production matrix by
unit is shown :numref:`fig8-1-141` in for text output.

.. _fig8-1-141:

.. _8-1-4-37:

Source vector by unit number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source vector by unit is the eigenvector of the fission production
matrix by unit and is printed if **MKU**\ =YES is specified in the
parameter data. It represents the fission source for the units used in
the problem. The components of the source vector should sum to 1.0.
An example of the source vector by unit is given in :numref:`fig8-1-142` . The average
self-multiplication by unit is printed following the source vector. This
value of self-multiplication includes those histories born in the unit
which cause fissions in the same unit regardless of whether or not it
exited and then returned. Therefore, this value will not agree with the
value printed for the self-multiplication of the unit as described in
Sect. :ref:`8-1-4-33`  if the problem uses multiple units, if the system is reflected,
or if a differential albedo is used in the problem.

Cofactor k-effective by unit number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cofactor k-effective for a given unit is the k-effective of the
system calculated without the fission source of that unit. Cofactor
k-effectives are printed if **MKU**\ =YES is specified in the parameter
data. Calculating and printing cofactor k-effectives by unit can be
avoided by specifying **CKU**\ =NO in the parameter data. This step is
accomplished by determining the eigenvalue of the fission production
matrix by unit after it has been reduced by the row and column
associated with that unit. An example of the cofactor k-effective by
unit is given in :numref:`fig8-1-143`.

Cofactor k-effective by hole number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cofactor k-effective for a given hole is the k-effective of the
system calculated without the fission source of that hole and is

The source vector by array number is the eigenvector of the fission
production matrix by array number and is printed if **MKA**\ =YES is
specified in the parameter data. The source vector should sum to 1.0.
An example of the source vector by array number is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-150`. The

Cofactor k-effective by array number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cofactor k-effective by array number is the k-effective of the
system calculated without the fission source of that array and is
calculated if **CKA**\ =YES is entered in the parameter data. This is
achieved by determining the eigenvector of the fission production matrix
by array after reducing it by the row and column associated with the
specified array. :numref:`fig8-1-151` is an example of the cofactor k-effective by array
number.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fission density edit is optional. Subroutine KEDIT prints the
neutron production density and the fission density for each geometry
region if **FDN**\ =YES and **NUB**\ =YES is specified in the parameter
data (these are the default values). If **NUB**\ =NO is specified, but
**FDN**\ =YES, then only the production density will be given. An
example of the fission density edit is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-152`.

The UNIT is the unit number from the geometry data, the REGION is the
region number relative to the unit, the PRODUCTION DENSITY is the
neutrons produced per cm\ :sup:`3` per source-neutron, and the FISSION
DENSITY is the fissions per cm\ :sup:`3` per source-neutron for that
geometry region, the PERCENT DEVIATION is 100 times the fractional
standard deviation associated with the production density and/or the
fission density, the TOTAL PRODUCTIONS is the total number of neutrons
produced per source neutron, and the TOTAL FISSIONS is the total number
of fissions per source neutron in the geometry region.

Frequency distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A frequency distribution consists of a bar graph indicating the number
of generations having k-effective in a specified interval. The intervals
are determined by the code, based on the upper and lower limits of the
k-effectives calculated for the generations. In this example, one
asterisk is printed for each generation k-effective. Four frequency
distributions are printed as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-154`.

1-D macroscopic cross sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The decision to print the 1-D mixture cross sections is optional. They
are printed only if **XS1**\ =YES is specified in the parameter data.
The 1-D mixture cross sections for a mixture are shown in :numref:`fig8-1-163`.
The HTML output is accessed with the *Mixture Cross Sections* link in
the *Derived Data* section. The top menu on the right side of the window
is used to set the mixture displayed in the bottom menu on the right
side of the window. The bottom menu contains hyperlinks to all available
edits for mixture cross sections. The 1-D cross sections are accessed
with the *Neutron Cross Sections* link in the bottom menu for the
desired mixture.

  Example 1-D macroscopic cross section in HTML output.

When the 1-D mixture cross sections are printed, the problem title is
printed at the top of the page. The mixture ID, mixture index and
mixture number are then printed. ID is the mixture number from the
mixing table and mixture index is the index used to reference it and
mixture number is its identifier. This step is followed by a heading to
identify the different 1-D cross sections. *GROUP* is the energy group,
*sigt* is the total cross section for the mixture, *sigs* is the
nonabsorption probability, *siga* is the absorption probability, *signu*
is the production probability, *chi* is the fission spectrum, *mwa1* is
the pointer for the first position of the cross sections for the energy
group, *mwa2* is the pointer for the last position of the cross sections
for the energy group, and *mwa3* contains the group for the transfer
corresponding to the first position. *SUM* is the sum of the absorption
probability and the nonabsorption probability. The nonabsorption
probability and the production probability are not true probabilities in
that they may be greater than 1. This is because the nonabsorption
probability has the (n,2n) transfer array summed into the total transfer
array twice, and the (n,3n) is summed three times, etc. The absorption
probability is defined as the absorption cross section divided by the
total cross section. The nonabsorption probability is the sum of the
group-to-group transfers for this group divided by the total
cross section. The production probability is defined as the fission
production cross section divided by the total cross section
(νΣ\ :sub:`f`/Σ\ :sub:`T`).

  Example of k-effective by generation in HTML output.

The problem title is printed at the top of the page. A descriptive
heading is printed at the top of each column of data. The data printed
include (1) the generation number, (2) the k-effective calculated for
the generation, (3) the average value of k-effective through the current
generation (excluding the first two generations), (4) the deviation
associated with the average k-effective, and (5) the matrix k-effective
for the generation and the deviation associated with the matrix
k-effective. The last two columns are filled with zeros if the user did
not specify matrix k-effective calculations. The matrix k-effective is
the largest eigenvalue of the fission production matrix. Matrix
information can be calculated based on (1) position index, (2) unit
number, (3) hole number, and (4) array number. The matrix k-effective
printed in the sixth column is based on this order. If the matrix
k-effective is calculated by position index, it is the one printed in
the sixth column. The matrix k-effective by unit number is given second
preference, followed by hole number and then array number. After the
last generation, a message is printed to indicate why execution was
terminated. If matrix k-effectives were calculated, this is followed by
a message stating the method used to determine the matrix k-effective.

The user should examine this portion of the results to ensure that the
two methods of calculating k‑effective are in acceptable agreement and
to verify that the average value of k-effective has become relatively
stable. If the k-effectives appear to be oscillating or drifting
significantly, the user should consider rerunning the problem with a
larger number of histories per generation.

If a problem is restarted, the generation numbers and k-effectives are
printed and the words FROM RESTART UNIT are printed in the elapsed time
column. All other columns are blank. When the generation at which the
problem is to be restarted is reached, the print reverts to the normal
format as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-126`.

Flux edit
^^^^^^^^^

Printing the fluxes is optional; they are only printed if **FLX**\ =YES
is specified in the parameter data. The fluxes are printed for each unit
and each geometry region in the unit for every energy group.

In the HTML output, a table of flux data can be accessed with the
*Scalar* *Fluxes* under *Fluxes* in the *Results* section, as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-192`.
The fluxes for each unit in the problem are accessed from links on the
right side of the page. Separate links are presented for *Angular
Fluxes* and *Flux Moments* if they are requested in the problem.

Flux plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the HTML output, the applet version of Javapeño is used for plotting
flux data. Clicking on the *Flux Plots* link under *Fluxes* in the
*Results* reveals a page with the Javapeño applet with the flux data
file pre‑loaded. Double-clicking on a data title on the right side of
the plot window will cause the corresponding data to be plotted. An
example of this page with some flux data plotted is shown in :numref:`fig8-1-193`. Here, the
scalar flux for each region of each unit is listed, followed by the flux
moments. The flux moments are identified according to their spherical
harmonics components, not the Legendre order. Moments 1–3 correspond to
the three first order components of the expansion, moments 4–8
correspond to the second order components of the expansion and
moments 9–15 correspond to the third order components of the expansion.
For the example data shown in :numref:`fig8-1-193`, only scalar fluxes (0\ :sup:`th` order
expansion) and first order expansion terms were computed.

Frequency distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A frequency distribution consists of a bar graph indicating the number
of generations having k-effective in a specified interval. The intervals
are determined by the code based on the upper and lower limits of the
k-effectives calculated for the generations. In the HTML output, the
Javapeño applet is used to display the frequency distributions, as shown
in :numref:`fig8-1-194`.

Warning messages and error messages
-----------------------------------

KENO prints warning and error messages that are identified by K5- or K6-
for KENO V.a and KENO-VI, respectively, followed by a unique number
(i.e., K5-001 is the identifier of the first message for KENO V.a). The
generic symbol for messages originating in KENO V.a and KENO-VI is K?,
where the question mark stands for 5 or 6. For additional information
concerning the message, refer to the identifier number in this section.

Warning messages appear when a possible error is encountered. If the
code alters data, that fact is stated in the message. It is the
responsibility of the user to verify correct usage when a warning
message is printed.

When an error is encountered, the error flag MFLAG is set true and an
error message is printed. The code stops if the error is too severe to
continue. The warning and error messages in this section may show an
underscore___\_ or a numbered underscore (1) where data will be printed
by the code. The explanation of the message will show an underscore or a
numbered underscore to indicate the corresponding data.

THE REFLECTOR DIMENSIONS ARE INCONSISTENT.

  This KENO-VA message is from subroutine JOMCHK. It is a companion to
  message K?-095 and is printed whenever one or more intersecting geometry
  regions are encountered in the external reflector.

KMSG095
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-095 FOLLOWS:
REGION NUMBER ___ IN UNIT NUMBER ___ CONTAINS AN ERROR IN THE DIMENSIONS.

  This message from subroutine VOLUME indicates an error in the geometry
  input data such that the negative dimension specification for a cube or
  cuboid is larger than the positive dimension specification (i.e., the
  −X dimension is greater than the +X dimension, or the −Y dimension is
  greater than the +Y dimension or the −Z dimension is greater than the +Z
  dimension). This message is also printed if the magnitude of the chord
  for a hemicylinder or hemisphere is larger than the radius. See
  :ref:`8-1-2-4` for assistance in specifying the geometry correctly.

KMSG096
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-096 FOLLOWS:
THE VOLUME DEFINED BY REGION ___ IN UNIT ___ IS NEGATIVE.

  This message from subroutine VOLUME is printed whenever a negative
  volume is calculated. This can be caused by the positive dimension being
  smaller than the negative dimension on a face of a geometry region. It
  can also be caused by having intersecting regions, or it may be the
  result of round-off when the volumes are calculated. Either the geometry
  regions are incorrectly specified, the data are out of order, or the
  dimensions are so tight fitting that round-off causes the net volume of
  the region to be negative. If the error is caused by round-off, adjust
  the appropriate dimensions slightly. See :ref:`8-1-2-4`.

KMSG097
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-097 FOLLOWS:
THE VOLUME FOR UNIT ___ IS NEGATIVE.

  This message is from subroutine VOLUME. A negative volume for a unit can
  be caused by having intersecting regions within the unit, or by having a
  unit consisting of one region and having a positive dimension smaller
  than the negative dimension on one or more faces. Message K5-95 or K5-96
  may accompany this message. See :ref:`8-1-2-4` for assistance in

  This message is from subroutine START. It indicates that none of the
  mixtures used in this problem has an associated fission spectrum. Either
  the geometry data did not specify a fissionable mixture number, the
  mixing table is incorrect, the wrong mixed cross section data set was
  mounted, or the mixed cross section data set was incorrectly or
  incompletely made. A STOP 128 is executed in conjunction with this

NEUTRONS CAN BE STARTED FOR THE EXISTING GEOMETRY IF XSM,XSP,YSM,YSP,ZSM AND ZSP ARE ENTERED AS START DATA.
XSM,XSP,YSM,YSP,ZSM AND ZSP MUST FIT WITHIN THE OUTER REGION OF THE REFLECTOR.

  This message is from subroutine START. Start type 0 allows starting
  points throughout noncuboidal regions. If a start type other than 0 or 6
  is desired and the outermost region of the reflector is not a cube or
  cuboid, then data must be entered to specify an imaginary cube or cuboid
  within this outer region. See :ref:`8-1-2-8` for assistance in specifying
  this data.

KMSG103

THE OVERALL COORDINATES MAY NOT BE PRINTED FOR A BARE ARRAY.

  If XSM, XSP, YSM, YSP, ZSM, ZSP were entered in the start data, they
  should fit within the overall coordinates of the system. The overall
  coordinates may not be printed for a bare array. This message from
  subroutine START may result from precision difficulties. It is allowed
  to occur a maximum of five times before being considered fatal. A code
  error may be the cause of this message if it becomes fatal.

KMSG105
K?-105     \****\* WARNING, ONLY ___ INDEPENDENT STARTING POSITIONS WERE GENERATED. \****\*

  This message is from subroutine START. KENO must have *npb* (**NPG**\ =,
  see parameter data, :ref:`8-1-2-3`) starting positions. This message is
  to inform the user that fewer than *npb* starting positions were
  generated. The remaining starting positions are randomly selected from
  those that were generated, thus giving duplicate starting positions. If
  the number of independent starting positions is nearly *npb*, the
  starting distribution is probably acceptable. If it is much smaller than
  *npb*, a different start type should be used to give a better starting
  distribution (see :ref:`8-1-2-8`). The amount of time allowed to generate
  the starting positions is controlled by parameter **TBA**\ = (see
  :ref:`8-1-2-3`). If the start data are appropriate, it may be necessary
  to increase the value of **TBA** to ensure generating *npb* starting
  positions.

KMSG106
\****\* ERROR \****\* K6-106 FOLLOWS:
POSIT ERROR --- UNIT ___ HAS MULTIPLY DEFINED SPACE AT

  This KENO-VI message from subroutine POSIT is usually the result of an
  incorrectly specified starting point for the initial source distribution
  when **NST**\ =3, 4 or 6 is specified in the start data. The starting
  point may not be consistent with the unit’s position in the global
  array. The message can also be caused by improperly specifying media
  records. **MEDIA** records in the specified units should be checked for
  multiply defined volumes. X, Y, Z is the location of the neutron, and
  SECTOR INSIDE is the sectors which contain that point. See :ref:`8-1-2-4`
  for correct geometry words.

KMSG107
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-107 FOLLOWS:
POSIT ERROR --- UNIT ___ HAS AN UNDEFINED SPACE AT
X = ___   Y = ___   Z = ___

  This message from subroutine POSIT may result from not specifying all
  volumes in the unit using media records. It could also occur from start
  data if a particle is attempting to start outside the global unit or in
  an undefined space. Geometry should be checked for the specified unit.


KMSG108

KMSG110
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-110 FOLLOWS:
THE PROBLEM WILL NOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE NO FISSILE MATERIAL WAS FOUND.

  This message from subroutine VOLFIS occurs when the volume of fissile
  material is found to be zero. It should be verified that the fissile
  material was correctly specified in the geometry data, and the volume of
  the fissile material in the printout should be nonzero. The mixing table
  should be verified as being correct or that the correct Monte Carlo
  mixed cross section data set has been used if a mixing table is not
  used. If the fissile region is small compared to the rest of the problem
  and the region volumes are calculated using TRACE or RANDOM types with
  default number of traces or particles, the fissile region volumes may be
  incorrect (even zero). If the volumes calculate to be zero, this message
  may be issued. In this case, the volume calculation (see :ref:`8-1-2-13`)
  should be corrected. A STOP 131 is executed when this message is
  printed.

  This message is from subroutine RDCALC. The restarted problem can turn
  off fluxes if the parent case that wrote the restart data set calculated
  fluxes. However, if the parent case did not calculate fluxes, the
  restarted problem cannot calculate fluxes either. If the correct restart
  data set was mounted on *rstrt* (**RST**\ = in :ref:`8-1-2-3`), the
  parameter data **FLX**\ =YES must be removed from the input data or
  **FLX**\ =NO must be entered later in the parameter data of the
  restarted problem.

KMSG115
\****\* ERROR \****\* K?-115 FOLLOWS:
PARAMETER DATA SPECIFIED REGION DEPENDENT FISSIONS AND ABSORPTIONS,

  This message is from subroutine RDCALC. The restarted problem specified
  **FAR**\ =YES in the parameter data block but the parent case that wrote
  the restart data set did not calculate region-dependent fissions and
  absorptions. The restarted problem can turn off region-dependent data if
  the parent case calculated them, but cannot turn them on if they were
  not calculated by the parent case. It should be verified that the
  correct restart data set is mounted on *rstrt* (**RST**\ = in
  :ref:`8-1-2-3`). **FAR**\ =YES should be removed from the parameter data
  of the restarted problem, or **FAR**\ =NO should be added later in the

  entries were supplied for the geometry word **REFLECTOR**. The mixture
  ID, bias ID, one of the thickness/region specifications or the number of
  regions to be generated was omitted or incorrectly specified. Each
  **REFLECTOR** entry requires (1) a mixture ID, (2) a bias ID, (3) N
  entries for the thickness/region specifications, and (4) the number of
  regions to be generated. The thickness/region can be obtained from the
  Increment Thickness column of :numref:`tab8-1-20` for the material to be used
  in the regions generated by the **REFLECTOR** specification. N is the
  number of thickness/region specifications required by the geometry
  shape: N=1 for spheres or hemispheres, N=3 for cylinders and
  hemicylinders, and N=6 for cubes, cuboids, and cores. A flag is set to
  terminate the problem when the input data reading is completed.

  This message from subroutine SORTA indicates that the array data specified in
  the problem are recursively nested. An example of this follows:

  array 1 contains array 3
  array 2 contains array 1
  array 3 contains array 2

  Thus the definition of array 1 and array 3 are intertwined in a never-ending loop.
  The array data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`) should be corrected and the problem resubmitted.
  If the input data did not specify recursive nesting, a code error has occurred.
  A STOP 139 is executed in conjunction with this message.

THE HOLES ARE RECURSIVELY NESTED.

  This message from subroutine HOLE indicates that the geometry region data
  description (:ref:`8-1-2-4`) specifies holes that are recursively nested.
  This can occur if a unit contains a hole whose definition traces back to
  the same unit or are defined in terms of each other. A simple example of
  recursive nesting is

  KENO V.a:

  ::

    UNIT 1 	CUBE  0  1  2P10.0    HOLE  2  3*0.0
    UNIT 2 	CUBE  0  1  2P10.0    HOLE  1  3*0.0

  KENO-VI:

  ::

    UNIT 1 CUBOID  10 6P10.0 BOUNDARY 10 HOLE 2 1  3*0.0
    UNIT 2 CUBOID  10 6P10.0 BOUNDARY 10 HOLE 1 1  3*0.0

  Thus **UNIT** 1 contains **UNIT** 2 and **UNIT** 2 contains **UNIT** 1.
  The geometry region data should be checked for recursive nesting. In the
  absence of recursive nesting, a code error is the probable cause of this
  message. A STOP 143 is executed when this message occurs and a traceback
  is printed.

  defined to be the array number in the global unit or of the last
  **ARRAY** description that does not immediately follow a **UNIT**
  definition (i.e., other geometry definitions occur between **UNIT** and
  **ARRAY**). The data should be corrected and the problem resubmitted.

  This message from subroutine SORTA occurs if **GBL**\ = in the array
  data (:ref:`8-1-2-5`) does not agree with the global array number
  implicitly set in the geometry region data (:ref:`8-1-2-4`). The geometry

.. _8-1-6-1:

The transport equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equation KENO solves may be derived in the following manner,
starting with the Boltzmann neutron transport equation which may be
written as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-3

  & \frac{1}{\mathrm{v}}\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial t}\left( X,E,\Omega,t \right) + \Omega \bullet \nabla\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega,t \right) + \Sigma_{t}\left( X,E,\Omega,t \right)\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega,t \right)

    & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ = S\left( X,E,\Omega,t \right)

  & \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ + \int_{E^{'}}^{}{\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}{\Sigma_{s}\left( X,E^{'} \rightarrow E,\Omega^{'} \rightarrow \Omega,t \right)\Phi\left( X,E^{'},\Omega^{'},t \right)}}d\Omega^{'}dE^{'}\ ,


where

     Φ(X,E,Ω,t) = neutron flux (neutrons/cm\ :sup:\ `2`/s) per unit energy at
     energy E per steradian about direction Ω at position X at time t
     moving at speed v corresponding to E;

     Σ\ :sub:`t`\ (X,E,Ω,t) = macroscopic total cross section of the media
     (cm:sup:`−1`) at position X, energy E, direction Ω and time t;

     Σ\ :sub:`s`\ (X,E′→E,Ω′→Ω,t) = macroscopic differential cross section
     of the media (cm\ :sup:`−1`) per unit energy at energy E′ per steradian
     about direction Ω′ at position X, and time t, for scattering to
     energy E and direction Ω;

     S(X,E,Ω,t) = neutrons/cm\ :sup:`3`/s born at position X and time t
     per unit energy at energy E per steradian about direction Ω (excludes
     scatter source).

Defining q(X,E,Ω,t) as the total source resulting from the external
source, scattering, fission, and all other contributions, the following
relationship can be written.

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-4

  q(X,E,\Omega, t) =

  & S(X,E,\Omega, t) + \int_{E^{'}}^{}{\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}{\Sigma_{s}\left( X,E^{'} \rightarrow E,\Omega^{'} \rightarrow \Omega,t \right)\Phi\left( X,E^{'},\Omega^{'},t \right)}}d\Omega^{'}dE^{'}\ .

Combining :eq:`eq8-1-3` and :eq:`eq8-1-4`, assuming media to be stationary and ignoring time-dependence, yields

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-5

  \ \Omega \bullet \nabla\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega \right)+ \Sigma_{t}\left( X,E,\Omega \right)\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega \right) = q\left( X,E,\Omega \right)

.. _8-1-6-2:

Continuous energy mode solution procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the relationship X′ = X − RΩ, using an integrating factor on both
sides of :eq:`eq8-1-5`, and defining

.. math::

  T(R) = \int_{0}^{R} \Sigma_{t}(X - R^{'}\Omega, E)dR ,

the following equation can be written.

At this point, the problem becomes an eigenvalue problem. If there is no
external source, the source may be defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-6

  \Phi(X,E,\Omega) = \int_{O}^{\infty}q(X - R\Omega,E,\Omega)e^{-T(R)}dR

At this point, the problem becomes an eigenvalue problem. If there is no external source, the source may be defined as


.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-7

  q\left( X,E,\Omega \right) = & \int_{}^{}{\int_{}^{}{{dE^{'}d\Omega^{'}\ \Phi\left( X,E^{'},\Omega^{'} \right)\ \Sigma}_{s}\left( X,E^{'} \rightarrow E,\Omega^{'} \cdot \Omega \right)}}

  & + \ \frac{1}{k}Q^{'}(X,E,\Omega) ,

where

k
  is the largest eigenvalue of the integral equation,

Q′(X,E,Ω)
  is the fission source at position X for energy E and
  direction Ω (all fission contributions to point E from all energy
  points in the previous generation),

Σ\ :sub:`s`\ (X,E′→E,Ω′:math:`\cdot` Ω)
  is the scattering cross section for
  scattering at position X from energy point E′ and direction Ω′ to
  energy point E and direction Ω.

Assuming the fission neutrons to be isotropic, the fission source
Q′(X,E,Ω) can be written as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-8

  Q^{'}(X,E,\Omega) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{E^{'}}^{}\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}dE^{'}d\Omega^{'}\Phi(X,E^{'},\Omega^{'})\chi(X,E^{'}\rightarrow E)\nu(X,E^{'})\Sigma_{f}(X,E^{'}) ,

where

   χ(X,E′→E) is the fraction of neutrons born at energy point E from
   fission at energy point E′ in the media at position X,

   ν(X,E′) is the number of neutrons resulting from a fission at energy
   point E′ at position X,

   Σ\ :sub:`f`\ (X,E′) is the macroscopic fission cross section of the
   material at position X for a neutron at energy point E′.

Substituting :eq:`eq8-1-7` into :eq:`eq8-1-6` yields the following equation:

.. _ first equation says chapter 9

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-9

   \ {\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega \right) = \int_{0}^{\infty}{\text{dR }e^{- T\left( R \right)}\left\{ \frac{1}{k}Q^{'}\left( X - R\Omega,E,\Omega \right) \right.\ }}

   {+ \left. \ \int_{E^{'}}^{}{\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}{{dE^{'}d\Omega^{'}\Phi\left( X - R\Omega,E^{'},\Omega^{'} \right)\Sigma}_{s}\left( X - R\Omega,E^{'} \rightarrow E,\Omega^{'} \cdot \Omega \right)}} \right\}}

The definition of k may be given as the ratio of the number of neutrons
produced in the (n + 1)\ *th* generation to the number of neutrons
produced in the n\ *th* generation or the largest eigenvalue of the
integral equation. Using :eq:`eq8-1-8`, :eq:`eq8-1-6` can be written as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-10

  \ {\Phi\left( X,E,\Omega \right) =

Writing :eq:`eq8-1-10` in generation notation, multiplying and dividing
certain terms by Σ\ :sub:`t`\ (X,E) and multiplying both sides of the
equation by ν(X,E)Σ\ :sub:`f`\ (X,E), yields the following equation,
which is solved by KENO V in the continuous energy mode:

where n indicates the n\ *th* generation and n − 1 is the (n − 1)\ *th*
generation. Note that the left-hand side of the equation, ν(X,E)
Σ\ :sub:`f`\ (X,E)Φ\ :sub:`n`\ (X,E,Ω) is the fission production for the
n\ *th* generation.

The solution strategy used by KENO solves :eq:`eq8-1-11` by using an
iterative procedure. The fission production at point X at energy point E
due to neutrons in the (n − 1)\ *th* generation, normalized to the
system multiplication, is

.. math::

  \frac{1}{k}\int_{E^{'}}{}\int_{\Omega^{'}}{}\frac{\nu(X,E^{'})\Sigma_{f}(X,E^{'})}{\Sigma_{t}(X,E^{'})}\chi(X,E^{'}\rightarrow E)\Sigma_{t}(X,E)\Phi_{n-1}(X,E^{'}\Omega^{'})dE^{'}\frac{d\Omega^{'}}{4\pi}

The collision points used in KENO are chosen by selecting path lengths
from the distribution

e\ :sup:`−T(R)` ,

which is the probability of transport from any position X − RΩ to
position X.

The first collision density of neutrons at energy E per unit solid angle
about Ω resulting from the fission source produced by the (n − 1)
generation, normalized to the system multiplication, is

.. math::

  \Sigma_{t}(X,E)\int_{0}^{\infty}dRe^{-T(R)}\frac{1}{k}\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}\int_{E^{'}}^{}\frac{\nu(X-R\Omega,E^{'})\Sigma_{f}(X-R\Omega,E^{'})}{\Sigma_{t}(X-R\Omega,E^{'})}

The scattering source at position X emerging at energy E and direction :math:`\Omega` resulting from previous collisions in the same generation, is

The collision density at energy E, per solid angle about :math:`\Omega` is

The total collision density times :math:`\frac{\nu_{g}(X)\Sigma_{fg}(X)}{\Sigma_{tg}(X)}` is the relationship from which KENO picks the source points for the next generation.

Problem initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use continuous energy cross sections in the random walk,
various initialization tasks must be addressed for each problem. Based
on the mixture specifications for a problem, KENO reads the microscopic
cross section data for each nuclide and dynamically allocates storage
for the particular problem. For continuous energy problems, if
**UUM=**\ no then KENO will not allocate macroscopic cross sections for
each material, and will instead use the master set of microscopic cross
section data (on a non-unionized energy grid). This is the default
behavior. Storing cross sections on a material-based unionized energy
grid (**UUM=**\ yes) results in smaller cross section lookup times and
faster KENO runtimes; however, storing unionized cross section data for
every material can require a prohibitively large amount of memory for
problems with a large number of materials. Users should therefore only
set **UUM**\ =yes for relatively small models; experience is the best
guide as to what “small” means with respect to available system
resources. After finishing the cross section processing, KENO reads the
user-specified KENO data (See Sect. ) and stores the problem-dependent
data for retrieval during the random walk. After the data initialization
tasks are complete, the Monte Carlo random walk can be performed
according to the procedures that are documented in the subsequent
sections.

.. _8-1-6-2-2:

Initial source distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the Monte Carlo simulation can be performed, the initial source
distribution of neutrons must be sampled. Typically, each mixture in a
problem is composed of multiple isotopes, and each mixture must be
checked for the presence of fissionable material. For each fissionable
mixture, the volume fraction of fissionable material must be calculated
on a per isotope basis.

The first source distribution is comprised of the initial spatial
coordinates, direction cosines and energy for each neutron within the
problem. Regarding the coordinate values, both continuous energy and
multigroup KENO use the same start types, and the initial angular
distribution is sampled from an isotropic distribution. For the initial
energy distribution, the energy of each neutron must be sampled from the
continuous energy fission spectrum, χ(\ *E*), of a fissionable isotope
within the mixture. If more than one fissionable isotope is present, the
*i*\ :sup:`th` isotope can be selected using the following relation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-12

  \sum^{i-1}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{f} < R\sum^{N}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{f} \leq \sum^{i}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{f}

where

   :math:`\sum^{j}_f` = macroscopic fission cross section for the *j*\ :sup:`th`
   isotope,

   *R* = random number [0, 1),

   *N* = total number of fissionable isotopes in the mixture.

Note that the relation in :eq:`eq8-1-12`  requires the knowledge of the fission
cross section at a particular energy. Therefore, an initial energy of
0.025 eV is assumed for selecting the appropriate isotope to sample.
Once the *i*\ :sup:`th` isotope is selected, the initial energy is
sampled from the corresponding χ\ :sub:`i`\ (*E*).

.. _8-1-6-2-3:

Collision site selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each neutron must be tracked until the history is terminated via leakage
from the system or the particle is “killed” via roulette. The selection
of the next collision site is governed by the following probability
density function (PDF):

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-13

  f(x)dx = \Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)e^{-\Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)x}dx ,

where

   :math:`\Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)` = macroscopic total cross section for mixture *m* at
   energy *E*,

   *x* = spatial variable.

The PDF in :eq:`eq8-1-13`  describes the probability that a neutron will have an
interaction between *x* and *x* + *dx* along its flight path.
Integrating :eq:`eq8-1-13`  over the spatial variable yields the following
cumulative distribution function (CDF):

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-14

  F(x) = \int^{x}_{0}\Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)e^{-\Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)x^{'}}dx^{'} = 1 - e^{-\Sigma^{m}_{t}(E)x} ,

and the next collision site is determined by setting the CDF in :eq:`eq8-1-14` 
equal to a random number on the interval [0, 1) and solving for *x*.

Note that :eq:`eq8-1-14` requires the total cross section for mixture *m* at
energy *E* in order to calculate the next collision site. As mentioned
in the :ref:`8-1-6-2-1`, KENO has two approaches to calculate the
macroscopic total cross section for each mixture; (1) use a unionized
energy grid (**UUM=**\ yes) – once KENO reads the microscopic data for
each isotope/nuclide in a mixture, KENO calculates and stores the
macroscopic total cross sections for the nuclides in each mixture (2)
on-the-fly mixture macroscopic cross section calculation (**UUM=**\ no)
– KENO does not store macroscopic cross sections and instead calculates
mixture cross sections upon request during particle tracking. Selecting
**UUM**\ =yes results in substantially increased memory usage for
problems with a large number of materials, making it impossible to
perform CE calculations for some detailed problems. Thus, it is highly
recommended to use **UUM**\ =no, the default setting, for the large
problems with multiple mixture definitions. For most cases selecting
**UUM**\ =no increases the runtime for KENO CE calculations by
approximately 17 %, but this feature also expands the code’s capability
to simulate very large problems with multiple mixture configurations.

Just as the **UUM** option allows the user to prevent KENO from storing
mixture cross sections on a unionized energy grid, the **M2U** option
toggles whether or not KENO stores cross sections on a unionized energy
grid for each individual nuclide. The default for this option is
**M2U=**\ no, which prevents the storage of all the transport cross
sections (i.e. inelastic scattering levels) for each nuclide in addition
to the major reactions that are already on the unionized energy grid
(i.e. total, fission, capture, and scatter) on an energy grid that is
unionized for that nuclide, and setting **M2U=**\ yes activates this
unionization and storage. **M2U=**\ no reduces the nuclear data memory
footprint of large models by several gigabytes, but it also increases
the runtime of these problems by several percent. It is encouraged to
investigate both **UUM** and **M2U** options in continuous energy
problems to optimize the runtime and memory depending on the user’s
models and applications. In the continuous energy depletion
calculations, **UUM** parameter is intentionally forced to “no” to
minimize the memory requirement of internal data storage. The cross
section storage and treatment options should be used consistently in
both validation and analysis calculations.


If any of the isotopes in the mixture have unresolved-resonance data and
corresponding probability-table data, KENO must determine if the neutron
energy is in the unresolved resonance range (URR) for each isotope
during the random walk. If the neutron energy is in the URR for an
isotope, the appropriate probability table must be sampled to obtain the
total cross section for each isotope (refer to :ref:`8-1-6-2-1` for sampling
probability tables). Subsequently, the macroscopic total cross section
for mixture *m* is adjusted to account for sampling the probability
tables. Once the revised Σ\ :sub:`t`\ :sup:`m`\ (*E*) is determined,
:eq:`eq8-1-14` can be used to select the next collision site within mixture *m* at
energy *E*.

.. _8-1-6-2-4:

Collision treatment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the collision site is determined, the collision can be modeled, and
the post collision parameters can be calculated. In the continuous
energy approach, each collision is modeled with an individual
isotope/nuclide. If a mixture is defined by multiple isotopes and/or
nuclides, the target must be selected at each collision site. If there
are *N* different isotopes/nuclides present in a mixture, the following
equation can be used to select the *i*\ :sup:`th` target for
interaction:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-15

  \sum^{i-1}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{t} < R \sum^{N}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{t} \leq \sum^{i}_{j=1}\Sigma^{j}_{t} ,

where,

  :math:`Σ^{j}_{t}` = macroscopic total cross section for the *j*\ :sup:`th`
  isotope/nuclide.

As noted in :ref:`8-1-6-2-2` and :ref:`8-1-6-2-3`, the collision energy may be in the
URR of one or more isotopes within the mixture. Consequently, the total
cross section for each isotope that has unresolved-resonance data is
sampled from the probability table information prior to selecting the
next collision site (see discussion in :ref:`8-1-6-2-1`). Subsequently, the
sampled values for the total and partial reactions are stored for
retrieval. Therefore, the macroscopic total cross section values that
are used in :eq:`eq8-1-15` are adjusted to account for sampling the probability
table data by retrieving the appropriate microscopic total cross section
value at energy *E*. Once the corrected values for Σ\ *t\ j*\ (*E*) are
determined, :eq:`eq8-1-15` can be used to select the target for interaction.

After selecting the collision target, the neutron’s weight is reduced by the nonabsorption probability:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-16

  w = \frac{\sigma^{i}_{s}(E)}{\sigma^{i}_{t}(E)}w_{b} = P_{nabs}(E)w_{b} ,

where

   :math:`\sigma^{i}_{s}(E)` = microscopic scattering cross section for the
   *i*\ :sup:`th` isotope/nuclide at energy *E*,

   :math:`\sigma^{i}_{t}(E)` = microscopic total cross section for the
   *i*\ :sup:`th` isotope/nuclide at energy E,

   *w\ b* = weight before collision.

The absorption and fission weights are calculated using the following relations, respectively:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-17

  w_{a} = \frac{\sigma^{i}_{a}(E)}{\sigma^{i}_{t}(E)}w_b ,

where

  :math:`\sigma^{i}_{a}(E)` = microscopic absorption cross section for the *i*\ :sup:`th` isotope/nuclide at energy *E*,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-18

  w_f = \frac{\bar{\nu}^{i}(E)\sigma^{i}_{f}(E)}{\sigma^{i}_{t}(E)}w_b ,

:math:`\bar{\nu}^i` = average number of neutrons released per fission at energy *E*,

:math:`\sigma^{i}_{f}(E)` = microscopic fission cross section for the *i*\ :sup:`th` isotope/nuclide at energy *E*.

If the collision isotope is in the URR at energy *E* and probability
table data are available, the collision probabilities must be adjusted
for sampling the partial reactions from the appropriate probability
table. In particular, the revised or sampled values for scattering,
absorption and fission must be used to calculate the collision weights
as defined by :eq:`eq8-1-16` through :eq:`eq8-1-18`. Depending on the neutron’s weight, splitting
and/or Roulette are performed as necessary. Once the appropriate weights
are calculated, the collision can be processed to determine the type of
interaction and the corresponding exiting energy and angle if secondary
neutrons are generated.

Because an explicit collision treatment is dictated by the point cross
section data, the type of reaction must be modeled explicitly in the
continuous energy version of KENO. :numref:`fig8-1-196` summarizes the cross section
hierarchy and can be used as an aide to understanding the collision
treatment in KENO in continuous energy mode. After selecting the
isotope/nuclide for interaction according to :eq:`eq8-1-15` and calculating the
weights using :eq:`eq8-1-16` through :eq:`eq8-1-18`, the collision is modeled using the following
procedures:

1. At each collision site, ensure that the type of collision is
   selected based on the cross section data. Moreover, the
   *k*\ :sup:`th` reaction can be randomly selected using the following
   relation:

   .. math::
    :label: eq8-1-19

    \sum^{k-1}_{j=1}\sigma_{j} < R\sum^{NI}_{j=1}\sigma_{j} < \sum^{k}_{j=1}\sigma_{j} ,

  where

     :math:`\sigma_{j}(E)` = cross section for the *j*\ :sup:`th` reaction,

     *NI* = number of elastic and nonelastic reactions (i.e., excludes
     neutron disappearance reactions).

  Note that the fission reactions (e.g., first chance fission, second
  chance fission, etc.) are excluded from :eq:`eq8-1-19`  because an implicit
  approach is used to treat fission. The details of the fission
  treatment are provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-5`. If a neutron production reaction
  with multiple exit neutrons such as (n, 2n), (n, 3n) is selected and
  the reaction is not a fission reaction, then the weight of the
  neutron is adjusted by the multiplicity to account for the additional
  neutrons, such as *w* = 2\ *w* for (n, 2n), *w* = 3\ *w* for (n, 3n).

    Cross section hierarchy for particle interactions.

2. Select the exiting angle for the collision. The cross section
   library provides a kinematics data block that provides the angle and
   energy distributions of secondary particles for a specified reaction.
   Each record for each section of a reaction provides a flag (NPU)
   indicating the number of secondary angles for that energy. If the NPU
   flag is 1 and the corresponding cosine value is -2 (set as a
   programming flag), then the reaction is isotropic. The exiting angle
   for the collision can be obtained as follows:

   i. Isotropic Emission

   If the LAND flag is 0 for the secondary angular distribution, the
   exiting angle cosine is sampled uniformly between −1 and +1:

   .. math::
    :label: eq8-1-20

    \mu = 2R - 1


   If the LAND flag is 1 for the secondary angular distribution, the
   exiting angle cosine must be sampled from an anisotropic distribution
   provided in the cross section library for the specified reaction.
   Details for sampling the exiting angle from the angular distribution
   data are provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-6`.

   The secondary angular distribution data are provided as a function of
   incident energy. The initial record of each section for a reaction
   provides the number of incident energies (*NE*) for the secondary
   angular and energy distributions. Corresponding to each incident
   energy is a secondary angular distribution. Therefore, there will be
   *NE* records used to describe the secondary angular data for each
   section.

   For each angular distribution record, there is an *LMU* flag and a
   *NPU* flag that describes the format of the data. The *LMU* flag
   designates whether the secondary distribution is provided in
   equiprobable cosine bins or in nonequiprobable cosine bins. The
   procedures for sampling the two types of data are provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7`.
   The *LMU* flag must be the same for all *NE* records within a
   section. The *NPU* flag specifies the number of cosine values in the
   distribution.

   Based on the incident energy of the neutron, the angular distribution
   data are sampled according to the procedures of :ref:`8-1-6-2-7` to obtain the
   exiting angle cosine, *μ*, in the lab system.

3. Select the exiting energy for the collision. In addition to the
   angular distributions of the kinematics data, the cross section
   library provides the energy distributions of secondary particles for
   a specified reaction.

   The secondary energy distributions are provided as a function of
   incident energy and secondary angle cosine in each section. Once the
   exiting angle cosine is selected, the exiting energy is selected from
   the energy distribution that corresponds to the (*E*, \ *μ*) pair.
   The exit energy is determined using the procedures of :ref:`8-1-6-2-7`.

   For each energy distribution record, there is an *LE* flag and an
   *NPE* flag describing the format of the data. The *LE* flag
   designates whether the secondary distribution is provided in
   equiprobable energy bins or in nonequiprobable energy bins. The
   procedures for sampling the two types of data are provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7` .
   Note that the *LE* flag must be the same for all *NE* records within
   a section for the secondary energy distribution data. The *NPE* flag
   specifies the number of secondary energy values in the distribution.
   For elastic scattering and discrete-level inelastic scattering, the
   *NPE* flag will equal the *NPU* flag due to the one-to-one
   correspondence between angle and energy.

4. Select the azimuthal angle η uniformly between 0. and 2π (i.e., η
   = 2\ *Rπ*).

5. Calculate the new direction cosines in the lab system using the
   following equations:

   .. math::
    :label: eq8-1-21

    u^{'} = u\mu - \sqrt{\nu^{2}+w^{2}} \sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}\text{cos}(\eta)

   .. math::
    :label: eq8-1-22

    \nu^{'} = \nu \mu + \frac{u\nu}{\sqrt{\nu^{2}+w^{2}}}\text{cos}(\eta)\sqrt{1-\mu^{2}} - \frac{w}{\sqrt{\nu^{2}+w^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}\text{sin}(\eta)

   .. math::
    :label: eq8-1-23

    w^{'} = w\mu + \frac{uw}{\sqrt{\nu^{2}+w^{2}}}\text{cos}(\eta)\sqrt{1-\mu^{2}} + \frac{v}{\sqrt{\nu^{2}+w^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}\text{sin}(\eta)

   where

   *u*, :math:`v`, and *w* = initial direction cosines,

   *u′*, :math:`v^{'}`, and *w′* = exiting direction cosines,

   *μ* = cosine of the scattering angle, and

   η = cosine of the azimuthal angle.

.. _8-1-6-2-5:

Fission treatment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted in the previous section, an implicit approach is used to treat
a fission event. During the collision treatment, the fission weight is
calculated using :eq:`eq8-1-18`. After processing the collision, the fission
weight is evaluated to determine if the fission treatment should be
applied. If the fission weight is greater than zero, the collision
occurred in fissile material. During the random walk, several fission
source points must be generated to provide an adequate representation of
the true source distribution. A minimum production factor is defined at
the beginning of each generation to ensure that enough fission points
are generated:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-24

  mpf = \frac{3.0\bar{k}}{\sqrt{FG}} ,

where

    :math:`\bar{k}` = running average of :math:`k_{eff}` through the current generation, and

    *FG* = number of histories per generation.

:eq:`eq8-1-24` represents an estimate of the 99% lower confidence interval for the distribution of the generation k-effective.

If the fission weight is greater than zero, a pseudo-fission weight is calculated as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-25

  pfw = \frac{w_{f}}{R} = \frac{\nu^{-i}(E)\sigma^{i}_{f}(E)}{R\sigma^{i}_{t}(E)}w_{b} .

If the pseudo-fission weight is less than the minimum production factor
given by :eq:`eq8-1-24` fission points are not generated and tracking of the
particle continues. However, if the pseudo-fission weight is greater
than the minimum production factor, *pfw* is redefined to be the minimum
production factor divided by a random number:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-26

  pfw = \frac{mpf}{R}

Once the pseudo-fission weight is redefined, a fission point can be
generated. Each time a fission point is generated, the pseudo-fission
weight is stored with the point in the fission bank. When a new point is
stored in the fission bank, the energy and angular cosine must be
selected from the kinematics data. Once the kinematics data are sampled
for the new fission point, the fission weight of the history is
decremented by the minimum production factor. If the remaining fission
weight is greater than zero, the fission treatment procedures are
repeated until the fission weight of the history has been exhausted
(i.e., *w*\ :sub:`f` ≤ 0).

.. _8-1-6-2-6:

Sampling details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preceding sections describe the procedures for the continuous energy
random walk for KENO. During the random walk, KENO must sample various
tables of data that may include probability tables and angle-energy distributions
for secondary particles.

.. _8-1-6-2-6-1:

Probability tables
..................


For each isotope with unresolved resonance data, multiple probability
tables may be used to describe the URR. The header block for each
isotope has an LPTAB flag that provides the number of probability tables
for an isotope. Each table is defined for a range of incident energies
between *E*\ :sub:`i` and *E*\ :sub:`i+1`, and the energy range for a table should not
overlap with another table for the isotope. For a particle with energy
*E*, a search must be performed to find the probability table with
energy bounds that bracket the particle energy (i.e., *E*\ :sub:`i` ≤ *E* <
*E*\ :sub:`i+1`). Once the appropriate table is identified, the table can be
sampled to obtain the total, elastic scattering, fission and capture
cross section values in the URR.

The probability table block provides four separate records that
correspond to each reaction within a table; however, the probability
table construction is based on the total cross section. Therefore, the
probabilities in each table refer to the total cross section band
values, and the bands should be sampled based on the total cross
section. Once the band is sampled, the corresponding partial reaction
cross section values are selected from the same band as the total
cross section. The cross section format permits the probability table to
be expressed in equiprobable or nonequiprobable cross section bands
(i.e., LBND = 0 or 1, respectively). The procedures for sampling both
types of tables are provided in the subsequent subsections.

.. _8-1-6-2-6-2:

Equiprobable cross section bands
................................

Each probability record has an NB parameter that designates the number
of cross section bands for a table. If the table is constructed with
equiprobable cross section bands, the *k*\ :sup:`th` band can be
selected as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-27

  k = NB \ ^{\ast} R + 1

where

     *R* = random number [0., 1).


Based on the sampled cross section band, the total cross section
corresponding to *k*\ :sup:`th` band is extracted from the table.
Likewise, the elastic scattering, fission and capture cross section
values that correspond to the *k*\ :sup:`th` band are also extracted
from their respective records in the probability-table block.

.. _8-1-6-2-6-3:

Nonequiprobable cross section bands
...................................

If the LBND flag is 1, the cross section bands in the table are not
equiprobable, and a different procedure must be used to sample the
appropriate cross section band. For this case, the probability values in
the table must be constructed as a cumulative distribution function. As
noted previously, each probability record has an NB parameter that
designates the number of cross section bands for a table, and the
*k*\ :sup:`th` band can be selected as follows:

Kinematics data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The kinematics data in the KENO library are provided in the lab or
target-at-rest system as opposed to the center-of-mass system. By
adhering to the lab coordinate system, KENO does not have to transform
between different coordinate systems during the random walk; however,
the energy and angle representations for elastic and discrete-level
inelastic scattering become more complex in the lab system. For example,
an angular distribution that is isotropic in the center-of-mass system
is anisotropic in the lab system. Moreover, the secondary energy
distribution as a function of exit angle in the lab system can be double
valued (i.e., two possible exit energies with respect to a single angle)
for energies above the threshold for the reaction. Likewise, a similar
double valued distribution is observed for elastic scattering with
hydrogen in the lab system if the actual mass ratio is used (i.e.,
*A* = 0.99928 as opposed to *A* = 1.0). Consequently, special care must
be exercised in the construction of the secondary angle and energy
distributions in the lab system.

The subsequent sections address the general procedures for sampling the
kinematics data with emphasis on the special cases that must be
addressed during the random walk. In :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-1`, the general
procedures for sampling the kinematics data are provided,
:ref:`8-1-6-2-7-4` discusses isotropic angular data with energy coupling,
while :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-5` discusses coherent and incoherent elastic
scattering. A discussion is also provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-6` to
describe the elastic and discrete-level inelastic treatment.

General procedures
..................

The kinematics data format is designed to accommodate coupled angle
energy distributions of secondary particles. The following discussion
provides the procedures for sampling the coupled distributions. Special
cases such as elastic and discrete level inelastic scattering are
discussed after the “General Procedures” section.

The sampling procedures in the following sections assume that the angle
and energy distributions are continuous in nature. As a result,
interpolation procedures can be used to obtain intermediate angle or
energy values between the tabulated angle or energy values. During the
course of KENO development, there may be a need to provide an average
angle or energy value for a bin. The kinematics format can be modified
as needed to accommodate additional angle and energy representations.
Therefore, the following procedures represent the anticipated approach
for sampling the current form of the kinematics data.

Exit angle cosine
.................

The first record for each reaction provides the number of sections
(NSECT) used to describe the kinematics for the reaction. Within each
section, the first record defines the incident energy range for the
section. After the first record for a section, the first block of data
provides the secondary angular distributions for *NE* different incident
energies within the energy range of the section. Consequently, there
will be *NE* different angular distribution records in the secondary
angle cosine block. The kinematics format permits the anisotropic
angular distributions to be expressed in either equiprobable or
nonequiprobable cosine bins (i.e., LMU = 0 or 1, respectively).
Moreover, the formats permit the number of cosine bins to vary as a
function of incident energy. In particular, each cosine distribution
record can have *NPU* secondary angles that correspond to *NPU* − 1
cosine bins.

**Equiprobable Cosine Bins.** If the incident energy, *E*, is between
*E*\ :sub:`i` and *E*\ :sub:`i+1`, the angle cosine is sampled in both
tables, and the exit angle cosine is obtained by interpolating between
the two tables. If the angular distribution is provided in equiprobable
cosine bins, the *a*\ :sup:`th` bin is selected from the *i*\ :sup:`th`
table as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-29

  a = (NPU_{i} - 1) \ ^{\ast} R_{1} + 1 = NA_{i} \ast R_{1} + 1 .

In :eq:`eq8-1-29` *a* denotes an integer quantity, and *NA*\ :sub:`i` is the number of
cosine bins for the *i*\ :sup:`th` table. Using a similar procedure, the
*b*\ :sup:`th` bin is selected from the *i*\ +1\ :sup:`st` table:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-30

  b = NA_{i+1} \ ^{\ast} R_{1} + 1

As noted for the *i*\ :sup:`th` table, *b* is an integer quantity in
Eq.  and *NA*\ :sub:`i+1` is the number of cosine bins for the
*i*\ +1\ :sup:`st` table. Once the cosine bins are selected, the cosine
of the exiting angle from the *i*\ :sup:`th` and *i*\ +1\ :sup:`st`
tables is calculated with :eq:`eq8-1-31` and :eq:`eq8-1-32`, respectively:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-31

  {\dot{\mu}}_{i} = \mu_{ia} + \left( a - NA_{i}*R_{1} \right)\left( \mu_{ia + 1} - \mu_{ia} \right) ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-32

  {\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1} = \mu_{i + 1b} + \left( b - NA_{i + 1}*R_{1} \right)\left( \mu_{i + 1b + 1} - \mu_{i + 1b} \right) .

The exiting angle cosine is obtained by interpolating between *i* and
*i*\ +1 based on the incident energy grid:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-33

  \ \mu = {\dot{\mu}}_{i} + \left( \frac{E - E_{i}}{E_{i + 1} - E_{i}} \right)\left( {\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1} - {\dot{\mu}}_{i} \right).

**Nonequiprobable Cosine Bins.** If the angular distribution is in the
form of nonequiprobable cosine bins, the *a*\ :sup:`th` bin is selected
from the cumulative distribution function for the *i*\ :sup:`th` table:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-34

  C_{ia - 1} < R_{1} \leq C_{ia}\ ,

where

    *C*\ :math:`_{ia-1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the :math:`a-1^{st}` cosine bin,

    *C*\ :math:`_{ia}`    = cumulative probability corresponding to the :math:`a^{th}` cosine bin,

Using a similar procedure, the *b*\ :sup:`th` bin is selected from the
*i*\ +1\ :sup:`st` table:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-35

  C_{i + 1b - 1} < R_{1} \leq C_{i + 1b}\ ,

where

    :math:`C_{ib-1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the :math:`b - 1^{st}` cosine bin,

    :math:`C_{ib}`   = cumulative probability corresponding to the :math:`b^{th}` cosine bin.

If the cosine bins are not equiprobable and the PDF is represented by a
continuous distribution, the bins are selected so that linear
interpolation can be performed in the PDF. Because the CDF is obtained
by integrating the PDF, the interpolation procedure for the CDF has a
quadratic form. The value for :math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i}` is obtained with
the following equation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-36

  {\dot{\mu}}_{i} = \mu_{ia} + \frac{\sqrt{P_{ia}^{2} + 2s_{i}(R_{1} - C_{ia - 1})} - P_{ia}}{s_{i}}\ ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-37

  s_{i} = \frac{P_{ia + 1} - P_{ia}}{\mu_{ia + 1} - \mu_{ia}}\ ,

where

  :math:`P_{ia}`   = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the :math:`a^{th}` cosine bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`, and

  :math:`P_{ia+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the :math:`a^{th}` cosine bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`.

Likewise, the equation for :math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1}` is obtained using
an equation that is similar to :eq:`eq8-1-36`

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-38

  {\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1} = \mu_{i + 1b} + \frac{\sqrt{P_{i + 1b}^{2} + 2s_{i + 1}(R_{1} - C_{i + 1b - 1})} - P_{i + 1b}}{s_{i + 1}},

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-39

  s_{i + 1} = \frac{P_{i + 1b + 1} - P_{i + 1b}}{\mu_{i + 1b + 1} - \mu_{i + 1b}} ,

where

    :math:`P_{i + 1b}`     = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower value of the :math:`b^{th}` cosine bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i+1}`, and

    :math:`P_{i + 1b + 1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper value of the :math:`b^{th}` cosine bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i+1}`.

The exiting angle cosine is obtained by interpolating between
:math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i}` and :math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1}` based on the
incident energy using :eq:`eq8-1-33`.

Exit energy
...........

In the kinematics data block, each incident energy has a secondary
distribution of *NPU* angle cosines. Therefore, there are *NPU*
(*E*, \ *μ*) pairs associated with each incident energy. For each
(*E*, \ *μ*) pair, there is a corresponding exit energy distribution
that can have *NPE* exit energies. Because the kinematics data are
tabulated in a coupled angle-energy format, the exit energy is obtained
by a 2-D interpolation as shown in :numref:`fig8-1-197`.

The objective of the sampling procedure is to sample the exit energy
*E′* in conjunction with the sampled angle cosine. Therefore, the
interpolation for the exit energy is performed with an equation that is
analogous to :eq:`eq8-1-33`:

.. _ last eq says chapter 9

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-40

  E^{'} = E^{'}_{i} + \bigg(\frac{E - E_{i}}{E_{i+1} - E_{i}}\bigg) (E^{'}_{i + 1} - E^{'}_{i})

Based on :eq:`eq8-1-40`, the values of *E′\ i* and *E′\ i+*\ :sub:`1` must
be obtained in order to calculate the exit energy for the collision. The
*a*\ :sup:`th` and *b*\ :sup:`th` cosine bins are selected according to
the procedures in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-1` from tables
*i* and *i*\ +1, respectively. As a result, the secondary energy
distributions corresponding to the *a*\ :sup:`th` and *b*\ :sup:`th`
cosine bins must be used to sample the exit energies from tables *i* and
*i*\ +1. The details for sampling the energy bins are deferred for the
moment. Once the appropriate energy bins are sampled from the two
tables, the interpolation for :math:`E^{'}_{i}` and :math:`{E_{i+1}` is obtained
with the following equations:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-41

  E_{i}^{'} = E_{ia}^{'} + \left( \frac{{\dot{\mu}}_{i} - \mu_{ia}}{\mu_{ia + 1} - \mu_{ia}} \right)\left( E_{ia + 1}^{'} - E^{'}_{ia} \right)\ ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-42

  E_{i + 1}^{'} = E_{i + 1b}^{'} + \left( \frac{{\dot{\mu}}_{i + 1} - \mu_{i + 1b}}{\mu_{i + 1b + 1} - \mu_{i + 1b}} \right)\left( E_{i + 1b + 1}^{'} - E_{i + 1b}^{'} \right) .

  Interpolation diagram for secondary angle-energy data.

Based on :eq:`eq8-1-41` and :eq:`eq8-1-42` the values for :math:`E^{'}_{ia}`, :math:`E^{'}_{ia + 1}`, and
:math:`E^{'}_{ia + 1 b+1}`are needed to
calculate :math:`E^{'}_{i}` and :math:`E^{'}_{i+1}`. The values for :math:`E^{'}_{ia}`
and :math:`E^{'}_{ia + 1}`correspond to secondary energies that are coupled
with the *a*\ :sup:`th` and :math:`a+1^{st}` angle cosines in Table
*i*. Likewise, the values for :math:`E^{'}_{i+1 b}` :math:`E^{'}_{i+1 b+1}`
correspond to the secondary energies that are coupled with the
*b*\ :sup:`th` and :math:`b+1^{st}` angle cosines in Table *i*\ +1.
Therefore, the exit energies from Table *i* are sampled from the
secondary energy distributions that correspond to (*E*, \ *μ*\ :sub:`i a`) and
(*E*, \ *μ*\ :sub:`i a + 1`), and the energies from Table *i*\ +1 are
sampled from the energy distributions for (*E*, \ *μ*\ :sub:`i+1 b`)
and (*E*, \ *μ*\ :sub:`i+1 b+1`).

As with the angular data, the secondary energy distributions may be
provided in equiprobable or nonequiprobable energy bins. The following
discussion provides the procedures for sampling the different
distributions.

**Equiprobable Energy Bins.** In Table *i*, the *k*\ :sup:`th` and
*m*\ :sup:`th` energy bins are sampled from the energy distributions for
(*E*, :math:`\mu_{i \ a}`) and (*E*, :math:`\mu_{i \ a+1}`), respectively. The
number of energy bins in a distribution is one less than the number of
energies in the table (i.e., *NPE* − 1). If the energy distributions are
provided in equiprobable bins, the *k*\ :sup:`th` and *m*\ :sup:`th`
bins are selected as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-43

  k = (NPE_{ia} - 1)\ast R_{2} + 1 ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-44

  m = (NPE_{ia+1} - 1)\ast R_{2} + 1 .

The exiting energy values for :math:`E^{'}_{i \ a}` :math:`E^{'}_{i \ a+1}` are interpolated as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-45

  E^{'}_{ia} = E^{'}_{iak} + \bigg[k - (NPE_{ia} - 1)\ast R_{2}\bigg] \bigg(E^{'}_{iak+1} - E^{'}_{iak}\bigg) ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-46

  E^{'}_{ia+1} = E^{'}_{ia + 1m} + \bigg[m - (NPE_{ia+1} - 1)\ast R_{2}\bigg] \bigg(E^{'}_{ia+1m+1} - E^{'}_{ia+1m}\bigg) .

In Table *i*\ +1, the *n*\ :sup:`th` and *q*\ :sup:`th` energy bins
are sampled from the energy distributions for (*E*, \ *μ*\ :sub:`i \ b`) and
(*E*,\ *μ* :sub:`i b+1`), respectively. As presented for the
*i*\ :sup:`th` table, the *n*\ :sup:`th` and *q*\ :sup:`th` bins are
selected from an equiprobable distribution in a manner analogous with
:eq:`eq8-1-43` and :eq:`eq8-1-44`:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-47

  n = (NPE_{i+1b} - 1)\ast R_{2} + 1 ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-48

  q = (NPE_{i+1b+1} - 1)\ast R_{2} + 1 .

The exiting energy values for :math:`E_{i+1 \ b}` and :math:`E_{i+1 b+1}` are interpolated as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-49

  E^{'}_{i+1b} = E^{'}_{i+1bn} + \bigg[n - (NPE_{i+1b} - 1)\ast R_{2}\bigg] \bigg(E^{'}_{i+1bn+1} - E^{'}_{i+1bn}\bigg) ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-50

  E^{'}_{i+1b+1} = E^{'}_{i+1b+1q} + \bigg[q - (NPE_{i+1b+1} - 1)\ast R_{2}\bigg] \bigg(E^{'}_{i+1b+1q+1} - E^{'}_{i+1b+1q}\bigg) .

The exit energy from the *i*\ :sup:`th` table (i.e., :math:`E^{'}`) is
obtained by substituting the values for :math:`E^{'}_{ia}` and :math:`E^{'}_{ia+1}`
into :eq:`eq8-1-41`, and the exit energy from the *i*\ +1\ :sup:`st` table (i.e.,
:math:`E^{'}_{i+1}`) is calculated by substituting the values for
:math:`E^{'}_{ib}` and :math:`E^{'}_{ib+1}` into :eq:`eq8-1-42`. Finally, the exit energy for
the collision is obtained by inserting the calculated values for :math:`E^{'}_{i}`
and :math:`E^{'}_{i+1}` into :eq:`eq8-1-40`.

.. _ last equation in this paragraph says chapter 9

**Nonequiprobable Energy Bins.** If the energy distributions are
provided in nonequiprobable bins, the *k*\ :sup:`th` and *m*\ :sup:`th`
bins are sampled according to the cumulative distribution values:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-51

  C_{iak - 1} < R_2 \leq C_{iak} ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-52

  C_{ia + 1m - 1} < R_2 \leq C_{ia+1m} ,

where

    :math:`C_{iak - 1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the *k*\ -1\ :sup:`st` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a}` distribution,

    :math:`C_{iak}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a}` distribution,

    :math:`C_{ia + 1m - 1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the m-1\ :sup:`st` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a+1}`) distribution, and

    :math:`C_{ia+1m}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the m\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a+1}`) distribution.

For the nonequiprobable bins, the bins for the secondary energy are selected
so that linear interpolation can be performed in the PDF. Since the CDF is
obtained by integrating the PDF, the interpolation procedure for the CDF is
quadratic in form. As a result, the value for :math:`E^{'}_{i \ a}` is obtained with the following equation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-53

  E^{'}_{ia} = E^{'}_{iak} + \frac{\sqrt{P^{2}_{iak} + 2s_{ia}(R_{2}-C_{iak-1})} - P_{iak}}{s_{ia}} ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-54

  s_{ia} = \frac{\sqrt{P_{iak+1} - P_{iak}}}{E^{'}_{iak+1} - E^{'}_{iak}} ,

where

    :math:`P_{iak}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the  (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a}`) distribution, and

    :math:`P_{iak+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i \ a}`) distribution.

Likewise, the value for :math:`E_{i \ a+1}` is obtained with the following equation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-55

  E^{'}_{ia+1} = E^{'}_{ia+1m} + \frac{\sqrt{P^{2}_{ia+1m} + 2s_{ia+1}(R_{2} - C_{ia+1m-1})} - P_{ia+1m}}{s_{ia+1}} ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-56

  s_{ia+1} = \frac{P_{ia+1m+1} - P_{ia+1m}}{E^{'}_{ia+1m+1} - E^{'}_{ia+1m}}

where

    :math:`P_{ia+1m}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the *m*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the  (E, :math:`μ_{i a+1}`) distribution, and

    :math:`P_{ia+1m+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the *m*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i a+1}`) distribution.

For nonequiprobable distributions in the *i*\ +1\ :sup:`st` table, the
*n*\ :sup:`th` and *q*\ :sup:`th` bins are sampled according to the
cumulative distribution values:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-57

  C_{i+1bn-1} < R_{2} \leq C_{i+1bn} ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-58

  C_{i+1b+1q-1} < R_{2} \leq C_{i+1b+1q} ,

where

    :math:`C_{i+1bn-1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the n-1\ :sup:`st` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 \ b}`) distribution,

    :math:`C_{i+1bn}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the *n*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 \ b}`) distribution,

    :math:`C_{i+1b+1q-1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the q-1\ :sup:`st` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 \ b+1}`) distribution, and

    :math:`C_{i+1b+1q}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the *q*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 \ b+1}`) distribution.

As observed for the i\ :sup:`th` table, the interpolation procedure for the CDF is
quadratic in form, and the value for :math:`E^{'}_{i+1 \ b}` is obtained as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-59

  E^{'}_{i+1b} = E^{'}_{i+1bn} + \frac{\sqrt{P^{2}_{i+1bn} + 2s_{i+1b}(R_{2} - C_{i+1bn-1})} - P_{i+1bn}} {s_{i+1b}} ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-60

  s_{i+1b} = \frac{P_{i+1bn+1} - P_{i+1bn}}{E^{'}_{i+1bn+1} - E^{'}_{i+1bn}} ,

where

    :math:`P_{i+1bn}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the *n*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the  (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 b}`) distribution, and

    :math:`P_{i+1bn+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the *n*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the  (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 b}`) distribution.

Likewise, the value for :math:`E^{'}_{i+1 b+1}` is obtained with the following equation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-61

  E^{'}_{i+1b+1} = E^{'}_{i+1b+1q} + \frac{\sqrt{P^{2}_{i+1b+1q} + 2s_{i+1b+1}(R_{2} - C_{i+1b+1q-1})} - P_{i+1b+1q}}{s_{i+1b+1}} ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-62

  s_{i+1b+1} = \frac{P_{i+1b+1q+1} - P_{i+1b+1q}}{E^{'}_{i+1b+1q+1} - E^{'}_{i+1b+1q}} ,

where

    :math:`P_{i+1b+1q}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the *q*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 b+1}`) distribution, and

    :math:`P_{i+1b+1q+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the *q*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the (E, :math:`μ_{i+1 b+1}`) distribution.


To obtain the exit energy for the collision, the energy from the i\ :sup:`th`
table (i.e., :math:`E^{'}_{i}`) is calculated by substituting the values for
:math:`E^{'}_{ia}` and :math:`E^{'}_{ia+1}` into :eq:`eq8-1-41`, and the exit
energy from the i+1\ :sup:`st` table (i.e., :math:`E^{'}_{i+1}`)
is calculated by substituting the values for :math:`E^{'}_{ib}` and :math:`E^{'}_{ib+1}`
into :eq:`eq8-1-42`.
Finally, the exit energy for the collision is obtained by inserting the
calculated values for :math:`E^{'}_{i}` and :math:`E^{'}_{i+1}` into :eq:`eq8-1-40`.

Isotropic Angular Distributions With Energy Coupling
....................................................

The kinematics format can accommodate isotropic angular distributions in
the coupled angle energy format. The following discussion describes the
special case with the appropriate sampling procedures. If the secondary
angular distribution is isotropic at an incident energy *E*, a single
exit cosine with a value of −2.0 is specified in the (*E*, \ *μ*) block.
Therefore, the exit angle cosine is sampled uniformly between −1.0 and
1.0:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-63

  \mu = 2R_{1} - 1 .

Because there is only one exit cosine specified in the (*E*, \ *μ*)
block, there is a single energy distribution record specified for the
(*E*, \ *μ*) pair. The general structure (i.e., material identifiers and
data flags are omitted for clarity) of the kinematics data within a
section for a reaction is presented in :numref:`tab8-1-25`. As a result, the
sampling procedure for the exit energy is based on the incident energy.

Once the angle is sampled according to :eq:`eq8-1-63`, the exit energy is sampled
in a manner that is analogous to the procedures of Sect. Exit energy. If
the incident energy, *E*, is between *E*\ :sub:`i` and
*E*\ :sub:`i+1`, the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin is sampled from the
distribution corresponding to *E*\ :sub:`i` using :eq:`eq8-1-64` or :eq:`eq8-1-65` for
equiprobable or nonequiprobable distributions, respectively.

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-64

  k = \big(NPE_{i} - 1\big)\ast R_{2} + 1 ,


or

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-65

  C_{ik-1} < R_{2} \leq C_{ik} ,

where

    :math:`NPE_{i}` = number of exit energies corresponding to :math:`E_{i}`,

    :math:`C_{ik-1}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the k-1\ :sup:`st` energy bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`, and

    :math:`C_{ik}` = cumulative probability corresponding to the k\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`.

For equiprobable energy bins, the exit energy corresponding to :math:`E_{i}` is calculated as follows:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-66

  E^{'}_i = E^{'}_{ik} + \bigg[k - \big(NPE_{i} - 1\big)\ast R_{2}\bigg] \bigg(E^{'}_{ik+1} - E^{'}_{ik} \bigg) .

If the secondary energy distributions are provided in nonequiprobable bins the exit energy is calculated using the following equation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-67

  E^{'}_{i} = E^{'}_{ik} + \frac{P^{2}_{ik} +2s_{i}\big(R_{2}-C_{ik-1}\big) - P_{ik}}{s_{i}} ,

and

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-68

  s_{i} = \frac{P_{ik+1} - P_{ik}}{E^{'}_{ik+1} - E^{'}_{ik}} ,

where

    :math:`P_{ik}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the lower boundary of the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`, and

    :math:`P_{ik+1}` = value of the PDF corresponding to the upper boundary of the *k*\ :sup:`th` energy bin in the distribution for :math:`E_{i}`.

By replacing *i* with *i*\ +1 in :eq:`eq8-1-64` through :eq:`eq8-1-68`, the exit energy :math:`E^{'}_{i+1}` can be
calculated from the secondary energy distribution corresponding to the
incident energy :math:`E_{i+1}`. Subsequently, :eq:`eq8-1-40` can be used to calculate the
exit energy.

Coherent and incoherent elastic scattering
..........................................

If thermal scattering law data are available for a material, the elastic
scattering mechanism may be specified as either coherent or incoherent
elastic scattering. Consequently, there is no change in energy resulting
from either collision. The secondary energy distribution block for each
(*E*, \ *μ*) pair only has one exit energy with a value equal to the
incident energy *E*. Therefore, the procedure for coherent or incoherent
elastic scattering reduces to sampling the exit angle cosine. The
procedures detailed in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-2` are used to sample the exit
angle cosine. The general structure of the kinematics data within a
section for coherent or incoherent elastic scattering is presented in
:numref:`tab8-1-26` with the material identifiers and data flags omitted for
clarity. Once the angle cosine is selected, the exit energy is set equal
to the incident energy.

Elastic and discrete-level inelastic scattering
...............................................

There is a one-to-one correspondence between the exiting angle and
energy for elastic and discrete level inelastic scattering . Once the
exiting angle is selected, the exiting energy is already determined
based on the kinematics equations documented in most conventional
reactor theory text books. However, an obscure fact is that the exiting
energy distributions for discrete-level inelastic reactions and hydrogen
elastic scattering can be double valued in the lab system. For discrete
level inelastic scattering in the lab system, the range of incident
energies that can have a double valued exit energy is given by the
following expression:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-69

  \Delta E_{double} =  \frac{Q}{A(1-A)} ,

where

     *Q* = the excess of the kinetic energy of the product particles over
     that of the original particles, and

     *A* = atomic mass ratio of the target mass to the mass of a neutron.

:eq:`eq8-1-69` provides the size in energy of the double valued region above the
threshold energy for the reaction. As indicated by :eq:`eq8-1-69`, the range of
energies for a double valued region is inversely proportional to the
target mass. Using :eq:`eq8-1-69` and ENDF/B data, the values of Δ\ *E*\ :sub:`double`
can be calculated for all discrete level inelastic scattering reactions
for all isotopes. A plot of Δ\ *E*\ :sub:`double` as a function of atomic mass
ratio is provided in :numref:`fig8-1-198` for all possible discrete level
inelastic scattering collisions for all isotopes. As shown in Fig.
:numref:`fig8-1-198`, the size of the double valued region approaches 1 MeV as the
mass ratio decreases. Because Δ\ *E\ double* can be relatively large,
the double valued anomaly cannot be ignored in the collision treatment.
The following discussion outlines the properties of the kinematics data
and the procedures for treating elastic and discrete level inelastic
scattering.

.. _fig8-1-198:

  Range of incident energies (∆\ *E*\ :sub:`double`) for double valued region as a function of mass ratio.

As noted previously, *NPU* secondary angle cosines are provided for each
incident energy for a reaction, and the cosine distribution can be
represented with either equiprobable or nonequiprobable distributions.
Depending on the type of distribution, procedures similar to those of
:ref:`8-1-6-2-7-3` are used to sample an equiprobable or nonequiprobable
angular distribution for the exit cosine in the lab system.

The angular data blocks for discrete level inelastic scattering and
hydrogen elastic scattering are similar in form to other reactions;
however, the exit lab cosines for discrete level inelastic scattering
are greater than zero in the double-valued region, and an exit lab
cosine may appear twice in the distribution with different
probabilities. As an example, discrete level inelastic scattering for
:sup:`7`\ Li is characterized by a double valued exit energy
distribution as a function of exit cosine in the lab system.
:numref:`fig8-1-190` provides the exit energy distribution for an inelastic
collision that leaves the :sup:`7`\ Li nucleus in the first excited
state (i.e., MT = 51) in the lab system. For :sup:`7`\ Li, the threshold
for MT = 51 is 5.4672 × 10\ :sup:`5` eV, and the double valued region
extends from the threshold energy up to 5.58259 × 10\ :sup:`5` eV;
therefore, the incident energy range of the double valued region is
~1.15 × 10\ :sup:`4` eV. As shown in :numref:`fig8-1-190`, the exit energy
distributions are provided for different incident energies within the
double valued region and an incident energy above the double valued
region. As the incident energy exceeds the maximum energy for which two
exiting energies can be produced, the secondary energy distribution
becomes single valued (i.e., one exit energy for an exit cosine).

Note that the double valued anomaly does not occur in the center-of-mass
system. Therefore, the two exit energies possible for the lab system
actually correspond to two different center-of-mass exit cosines. During
the preparation of the KENO library, the angular distribution tables for
discrete level inelastic scattering and elastic scattering for hydrogen
can be constructed in the center-of-mass system and subsequently
converted to the lab system. In order to properly construct the angular
distribution tables in the lab system, the minimum lab cosine,
*μ*\ :sup:`min`\ :sub:`lab`, must be determined because exit angles
below the minimum lab cosine are not possible.

For discrete level inelastic scattering and elastic scattering, the exit
cosine in the lab system can be expressed as a function of the
center-of-mass scattering angle, *μ*\ :sub:`cm`:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-70

  \mu = \frac{\gamma + \mu_{cm}}{\big(1+2\gamma\mu_{cm}+\gamma^{2}\big)^{1/2}} ,

where

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-71

  \frac{1}{\gamma} = \bigg[A^{2} + \frac{A\big(A+1\big)Q}{E}\bigg]^{1/2}

Physically, the quantity 1/γ represents the ratio of the exit velocity
of the neutron in the lab system to the center-of-mass velocity.
Moreover, the quantity 1/γ reduces to *A* for elastic scattering
(i.e., *Q* = 0). The minimum value for *μ* can be obtained by taking the
derivative of :eq:`eq8-1-72` with respect to *μ*\ :sub:`cm` which yields the following
expression:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-72

  \frac{d\mu}{d\mu_{cm}} = \frac{1+ \gamma\mu_{cm}}{\big(1+2\gamma\mu_{cm}+\gamma^{2}\big)^{3/2}} .

Setting :eq:`eq8-1-72` equal to 0 reveals that the minimum lab cosine
(*μ*\ :sup:`min`\ :sub:`lab`) occurs when *μ*\ :sub:`cm` = −1/γ. For elastic
scattering, the minimum lab cosine occurs when *μ*\ :sub:`cm` = −\ *A*. Because
hydrogen is the only nuclide with a mass ratio below 1, hydrogen is the
only nuclide that has a double valued exit energy distribution in the
lab system for elastic scattering.

During the preparation of the KENO library, the lab distributions for
discrete level inelastic scattering and hydrogen elastic scattering will
be constructed so that *μ*\ :sup:`min`\ :sub:`lab` is a boundary for an
angular bin, and no angular cosines in the lab system will be permitted
below *μ*\ :sup:`min`\ :sub:`lab`. As shown in :numref:`fig8-1-199` for
:sup:`7`\ Li, the exit cosines greater than *μ*\ :sup:`min`\ :sub:`lab`
will have two possible exit energies in the double valued region. As a
result, the angular distribution table in the library will have angles
that appear twice with different probabilities. For example, an angle
cosine *μ* may be present in the table with probabilities *P*\ :sub:`m` and
*P*\ :sub:`n`. Although the value of the angle cosine is the same for both
probabilities, the corresponding exit energy will be different for each
(*μ*, *P)* pair. In other words, the probability for an exit cosine
determines the location in the exit energy distribution table for
selecting the outgoing energy.

  :sup:`7`\ Li exit energy distribution for the first discrete
  level inelastic scattering reaction (MT=51). *E*\ :sub:`threshold` =
  5.4672 × 10\ :sup:`5` eV; ∆\ *E*\ :sub:`double` = 1.1539 × 10\ :sup:`4` eV.

Based on the format of the kinematics data, angle cosine distributions
are provided as a function of incident energy. If the incident energy,
*E*, is between *E*\ :sub:`i` and *E*\ :sub:`i+1`, then the *i*\ :sup:`th`
table is selected with probability *P*\ :sub:`i` and the *i*\ +1 table is
selected with probability *P*\ :sub:`i+1`:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-73

  P_{i} = \frac{E_{i+1} - E}{E_{i+1}-E_{i}} ,

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-74

  P_{i+1} = \frac{E - E_{i}}{E_{i+1} - E_{i}} .

Once the angular distribution corresponding to the incident energy is
selected, the exit angle cosine can be selected using procedures like
those in Sect. Exit angle cosine. For example, if the *i*\ :sup:`th`
incident energy is selected, either :eq:`eq8-1-29`  is used to select the
*a*\ :sup:`th` cosine bin for equiprobable bins, or :eq:`eq8-1-34`  is used for
nonequiprobable bins. Subsequently, either :eq:`eq8-1-31` or :eq:`eq8-1-36` is used
to calculate the exit angle cosine, depending on the type of angular
distribution provided.

.. _ last equation said chapter 9

The coupled secondary angle-energy data blocks (*E*, *µ*, *E′* ) follow
the angular data block in the kinematics data. For elastic scattering
and discrete level inelastic scattering, there is one possible exit
energy. Therefore, in the exit energy distribution block, a single exit
energy (*NPE* = 1) is provided for each (*E*, \ *µ*) pair, and the
general structure (i.e., material identifiers and data flags are omitted
for clarity) of the secondary energy distribution data block is
presented in :numref:`tab8-1-27`. Because only one exit energy is provided for
each (*E*, \ *µ*) pair, the probability for the exit energy is 1.0. As
indicated in :numref:`tab8-1-27`, a cumulative probability of 1.0 is stored for
each exit energy; however, the parameters stored in the PDF location are
the power-interpolation parameters needed to interpolate the exit
energy.

When an exiting angle :math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i}` is sampled between *µ*\ :sub:`a`
and *µ*\ :sub:`a+1`, the exiting energy values that correspond to
*µ*\ :sub:`a` and *µ*\ :sub:`a+1` for the incident energy *E*\ :sub:`i` can be used
to interpolate the exiting energy *E*\ ′ that corresponds
to\ :math:`{\dot{\mu}}_{i}`. Physically, the interpolation procedures
correspond to an interpolation along one of the incident energy curves
as depicted in :numref:`fig8-1-197`. In order to perform the interpolation, the
*a*\ :sup:`th` and *a*\ +1\ :sup:`st` (*E*, \ *µ*) pairs are located in
the secondary energy distribution block corresponding to *E*\ :sub:`i`.
Subsequently, the corresponding *a*\ :sup:`th` and *a*\ +1 exit energy
values (i.e., :math:`E^{'}_a` and :math:`E^{'}_{a+1}`) are read from the secondary energy distribution
record.

The exiting energy is interpolated with the following relation:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-75

  E^{'}\left( {\dot{\mu}}_{i} \right) = E_{a}^{'} + \left( \frac{{\dot{\mu}}_{i}^{P_{a}} - \mu_{a}^{P_{a}}}{\mu_{a + 1}^{P_{a}} - \mu_{a}^{P_{a}}} \right)\left( E_{a + 1}^{'} - E_{a}^{'} \right)\ ,

where

    *P* = is a “power-interpolation” factor for the *a*\ :sup:`th` cosine
    bin that is obtained from a fit to the *E′* distribution as a
    function of *µ*.

The interpolation procedure in :eq:`eq8-1-75` is analogous to the interpolation
scheme that has been used successfully to interpolate Bondarenko factors
as a function of temperature in the BONAMI module. If the curve is
monotonic in nature, the power-interpolation scheme can be used to
represent the curvature with a minimum number of points. For elastic and
discrete level inelastic scattering, the *E′*\ (*µ*) distribution is
monotonic and is suited for the power interpolation scheme. Note that if
*p* is 1, :eq:`eq8-1-75` reduces to a linear interpolation in *µ*-*E′* space.

Thermal scattering effects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A collision between a neutron and nucleus can be affected by the thermal
motion of the target nucleus. Moreover, ENDF provides thermal scattering
law data to account for the thermal effects of scattering with a
material below 5 eV; however, the scattering law data are only available
for a select number materials as shown in :numref:`tab8-1-28`. If thermal
scattering law data are not available, elastic scattering is treated
with the free gas approximation in the KENO library. For heavy nuclides
with 0 K scattering libraries available, the Doppler Broadening
Rejection Correction (DBRC) method is used instead. For DBRC-enabled
nuclides, thermal scattering effects are taken into account up to 210 eV
(although this parameter can be controlled by the user). More
information on DBRC is given in :ref:`8-1-6-2-9`.

The continuous energy cross section library is processed to account for
the appropriate scattering effects. As a result, the KENO cross section
library inherently accounts for thermal scattering using either the
thermal scattering law data or the free gas approximation. In other
words, the kinematics data based on thermal effects are combined with
the fast data to represent the collision kinematics for the material. As
noted previously, the kinematics data block for a reaction is divided
into sections that describe the collision kinematics for a range of
incident energies. As a result, the kinematics data structure has a
modular format that is beneficial for data library production. Because
of the kinematics data structure, the thermal scattering law data, which
are typically applied up to 5 eV, can be processed independently with
AMPX to obtain the angle energy probability distributions. Subsequently,
one or more sections in the kinematics data block can be used to
represent the thermal angle -energy distributions for energies up to
5 eV. Moreover, the fast kinematics data can be represented with one or
more sections for energies above 5 eV. As part of the library
preparation, the thermal kinematics data are combined with the fast
kinematics data block to complete the collision representation for the
entire range of incident energies. Because the thermal scattering
effects are treated during the processing of the cross section data for
a material, the thermal effects are inherently treated in KENO. During
the Monte Carlo random walk, the procedures provided in :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-2`
and :ref:`8-1-6-2-7-3` are used to sample the exit angle and energy
for the collision.

Doppler broadening rejection correction method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When colliding with a heavy nuclide, the thermal motion of the target
nuclide can significantly affect the exit angle and energy of the
neutron. The thermal motion of the target nuclide was previously
ignored, but this assumption has been proven inadequate by Dagan and
Becker :cite:`becker_proof_2009`.

A new sampling equation has been implemented to allow for Doppler
broadening of the scattering kernel. Removing this approximation can
have a significant impact on the critical eigenvalue of systems by
allowing neutrons to be upscattered into absorption resonances.
Currently, DBRC is enabled in KENO only for :sup:`238`\ U, and this
feature can be activated by setting the parameter **DBR**\ =1.

.. _8-1-6-2-10:

Doppler broadening methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CE KENO calculations will perform temperature adjustment of neutron
cross sections by default. The cross sections provided with SCALE are
typically supplied in 300 K intervals, and additional cross section
temperature resolution may be desired to model non–room temperature
systems or systems with significant temperature effects.

The capability to perform problem-dependent Doppler broadening of
nuclear cross sections has been implemented in KENO. This feature is
controlled by the **DBX** parameter, which causes KENO to perform
Doppler broadening on the cross sections in all compositions in a
problem before simulating particle histories. When this occurs, the
cross sections for each material are broadened to the temperature
assigned to that material in the **READ COMP** block, as long as the
requested temperature is more than 4 K from the library temperature.
Within this ±4 K band, the library temperature is used to avoid
difficulties with numerical instabilities in small cross section
adjustments. The default for this feature is **DBX=**\ 2, which performs
Doppler broadening for both the 1-D and 2-D cross sections. Current
options available are as follows:

-  **DBX** = 0 – Doppler broadening is not performed. KENO selects the
   library at the closest temperature. If desired, the user can use the
   **TTL** parameter to force a job abort if the library temperature is
   too far from the requested temperature. By default, **TTL**\ =-1, so
   the closest library will be used regardless of the temperature
   difference.

-  **DBX** = 1 –Doppler broadening is performed using a finite
   difference method on the one-dimensional cross sections that are
   temperature dependent. Logarithmic interpolation is also used to
   broaden the probability table data. When this option is used, the
   collision probabilities are recalculated after the Doppler broadening
   is complete to ensure consistency.

-  **DBX** = 2 –The same actions as **DBX** = 1 are performed, and
   Doppler broadening is also performed on the thermal moderator data by
   conducting interpolation on the double differential probability data
   present on the cross section library.

Nuclide level energy unionization is automatically disabled
(**M2U=**\ NO\ **)** when Doppler broadening is enabled in order to
reduce the memory usage. At this writing, research is in progress to
allow KENO to perform on-the-fly cross section Doppler broadening as
particle histories are being simulated.

equation—ν\ :sub:`g`\ (X) Σ\ :sub:`fg`\ (X)Φ\ :sub:`g,n`\ (X,Ω)—is the
fission production for the n\ *th* generation.

The solution strategy used by KENO solves :eq:`eq8-1-83` by using an iterative
procedure. The fission production at point X in energy group g due to
neutrons in the (n − 1)\ *th* generation, normalized to the system
multiplication, is

.. math::

    \frac{1}{k}\sum_{g^{'}}\int_{\Omega^{'}}\frac{\nu_{g^{'}}(X)\Sigma_{fg^{'}}(X)}{\Sigma_{tg^{'}}(X)}\chi \big(X,g^{'} \rightarrow g\big)\Sigma_{tg^{'}}\big(X\big)\Phi_{g^{'},n-1}\big(X,\Omega^{'}\big)\frac{d\Omega^{'}}{4\pi} .

The collision points used in KENO are chosen by selecting path lengths
from the distribution

  e\ :sup:`−T(R)` ,

which is the probability of transport from any position X − RΩ to
position X.

The first collision density of neutrons in group g per unit solid angle
about Ω resulting from the fission source produced by the (n − 1)
generation, normalized to the system multiplication, is

The scattering source at position X emerging in group g and direction Ω
resulting from previous collisions in the same generation, is

.. math::

    \sum_{g^{'}}^{}{\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}{\ \frac{\Sigma_{s}\left( X,g^{'} \rightarrow g,\Omega^{'} \cdot \Omega \right)}{\Sigma_{tg^{'}}\left( X \right)}\text{Σ}_{tg^{'}}\left( X \right)\ \Phi_{g^{'},n}\left( X,\Omega \right)d\Omega^{'}}}

The collision density in group g, per solid angle about Ω is

    \Sigma_{tg}\int_{0}^{\infty}{\text{dR}e^{- T\left( R \right)}\sum_{g^{'}}^{}{\int_{\Omega^{'}}^{}{{\frac{\text{Σ}_{s}\left( X - R\Omega,g^{'} \rightarrow g,\Omega^{'} \cdot \Omega \right)}{\Sigma_{tg^{'}}\left( X - R\Omega \right)}\text{Σ}_{tg^{'}}\left( X - R\Omega \right)\text{Φ}}_{g^{'},n}\left( X - R\Omega,\Omega^{'} \right)}}d\Omega^{'}\ }

The total collision density times :math:`\frac{\nu_g(X)\Sigma_{fg}(X)}{\Sigma_{tg}(X)}` is the relationship from
which KENO picks the source points for the next generation.

Collision treatment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A collision occurs in a geometrical region when a history exhausts its
mean-free-path length within the boundaries of the region. For each
collision, the absorbed weight and the fission weight are tabulated,
then the weight is modified by the nonabsorption probability. This new
weight is checked for splitting and Russian roulette, and if it
survives, the history is scattered. A new energy group is selected from
the cumulative transfer probability distribution. This group-to-group
transfer determines an angular scattering distribution, usually
expressed as a Legendre expansion of the cross section transfer array.
A set of discrete angles and probabilities are generated by a
generalized Gaussian quadrature procedure, preserving the moments of the
Legendre expansion of the angular scattering distribution. KENO treats
P\ :sub:`0` and P\ :sub:`1` Legendre expansions as special cases. If the
scattering distribution is isotropic, a flag is set to randomly select
new direction cosines from an isotropic distribution, instead of using
discrete scattering angles. If the distribution is a P\ :sub:`1`
expansion, KENO randomly selects the cosine of the scattering angle
according to

  (1) :math:`|\bar{\mu}| < \frac{10^{-10}}{3}`: scattering distribution is isotropic,

  (2) :math:`|\bar{\mu}| \leq 1/3: \mu = \bigg(\sqrt{1+6\zeta\bar{\mu}+\big(3\bar{\mu}\big)^{2}} - 1\bigg)/ 3\bar{\mu}`,

or

  (3) :math:`|\bar{\mu}| > 1/3: \mu = \zeta\big(1-|\bar{\mu}|\big) + \bar{\mu}`


where ζ is a uniform random variable between −1 and +1 and

:math:`\bar{\mu}` is the mean cosine of the scattering angle.

Otherwise, KENO randomly selects one of the discrete scattering angles
(μ). New direction cosines are then calculated according to the
following relationships where u, v, and w are the initial direction
cosines and u′, v′, and w′ are the direction cosines after the
collision:

    u' = ucos\ :math:`\Psi - \sqrt{\text{v}^{2} + \text{w}^{2}}`\ sin\ :math:`\Psi`\ cos\ :math:`\eta`

    v' = vcos\ :math:`\Psi + \frac{\text{uv}}{\sqrt{\text{v}^{2} + \text{w}^{2}}}\text{cos}\eta\text{sin}\Psi - \frac{\text{w}}{\sqrt{\text{v}^{2} + \text{w}^{2}}}\text{sin}\Psi\text{sin}\eta`

    w' = wcos\ :math:`\Psi + \frac{\text{uw}}{\sqrt{\text{v}^{2} + \text{w}^{2}}}\text{cos}\eta\text{sin}\Psi + \frac{\text{v}}{\sqrt{\text{v}^{2} + \text{w}^{2}}}\text{sin}\Psi\text{sin}\eta`

where

   sinψ = :math:`\sqrt{1-\mu^{2}}`,

   cosψ = μ = cosine of the scattering angle,

   η = a random azimuthal angle between 0 and 2π.

Fission point selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order for a fission to occur, a neutron must first have a collision.
The fission weight, :math:`\text{fisw}`, is defined as the neutron
weight, :math:`\text{wt}`, times the ν-fission probability,
:math:`\text{fnfp}`:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-84

  fisw = wt\  \times \ fnfp

Two important variables used in the processing of fission points are (1)
FWR, which is defined as the fission weight, :math:`\text{fisw}`,
divided by a random number, and (2) RAKBAR, which is defined as a factor
times the running average value of k-effective, AKBAR. This factor is a
function of the square root of the number of neutrons per generation and
was chosen because it usually produces an adequate number of independent
fission points and does not produce so many that an excessive amount of
time is spent choosing from the fission points produced.

The following procedure for generating fission points is repeated until
FWR is less than RAKBAR. A fission point is generated only if FWR is
greater than RAKBAR. Multiple fissions at the same point are allowed
only if :math:`\text{fisw}` is greater than RAKBAR. If
:math:`\text{fisw}` is greater than RAKBAR, a fission point is stored
with FWR set equal to RAKBAR divided by a random number and
:math:`\text{fisw}` is decremented by RAKBAR. Then the energy group of
fission is chosen randomly from the fission spectrum of the mixture in
which the fission occurred. The energy group of fission, the X, Y, and
Z position, the location of the unit within the array, the region
number, the value of FWR, the region number of the array boundary, and
the nesting data for holes and/or arrays are stored in the fission bank.
The quantity of fission points kept to be used as fission positions for
the next generation is limited to the number of positions in the fission
bank (input parameter **NFB**\ =). Typically **NFB** is equal to the
input parameter **NPG**, the number of neutrons per generation. If a
fission occurs and the fission counter is less than **NFB**, the fission
point information is stored in the fission bank. If a fission occurs and
the fission counter is greater than or equal to the number per
generation, a search is made to find the smallest stored value of FWR.
If FWR of the newly fissioned neutron is less than the smallest FWR in
the table, it is discarded. Otherwise, the information from the newly
fissioned neutron replaces that associated with the smallest value of
FWR found in the table.

When the next generation is ready to be processed, data are transferred
from the fission bank into the neutron bank to be used as starting
positions for the fission neutrons. If more than NPG neutrons are saved
in the fission bank, **NPG** of those having the highest values of FWR
will be used. If too few fission positions were stored (less than the
number per generation), a warning message to that effect (K?-132) is
printed, and additional fission points are randomly chosen from those
that were stored until the number of fission points available to start
the next generation is equal to the number of neutrons per generation.

Biasing or weighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to minimize the statistical deviation of k-effective per unit
computer time, KENO uses weighted tracking rather than analog tracking.
Weighted tracking accounts for absorption by reducing the neutron weight
rather than allowing the neutron history to be terminated by absorption.
To prevent expending excessive computer time tracking low-weight
neutrons, Russian roulette is played when the weight of the neutron
drops below a preset weight, WTLOW. Neutrons that survive Russian
roulette are assigned a weight, WTAVG. The value of WTLOW and WTAVG can
be assigned as a function of position and energy. The values used by
KENO are

   DWTAV = 0.5, the default value of WTAVG,

   WTAVG = DWTAV, the weight given a neutron that survives Russian
   roulette, and

   WTLOW = WTAVG/3.0, the value of weight at which Russian roulette is
   played.

A study :cite:`hoffman_optimization_1982` by Hoffman shows these default values to be reasonable for
bare critical assemblies. :numref:`fig8-1-200` from this study shows the
analytic relationship between the variance and WTLOW when WTAVG is 0.5.
Note that the default value of 0.167 for WTLOW is very close to the
minimum point on the curve. Experimental results of actual Monte Carlo
calculations\ :sup:`7` provide further assurance that 0.167 is an
optimum choice for WTLOW when WTAVG is 0.5.

.. _fig8-1-200:

  :width: 600

  Analytic estimate of the relationship between WTLOW and the variance, :math:`\sigma^{2}_{k}`, when WTAVG is 0.5.

:numref:`fig8-1-201`, also from the Hoffman study, shows the analytic
relationship between the variance and the value chosen for WTAVG for a
value of WTLOW = 0.167. Although the KENO default value for WTAVG is not
the optimum, a close examination of the data shows that the variance was
changing relatively slowly as a function of WTAVG. Even though this
study shows a value near 0.26 to be optimum for this system, further
studies of other systems are needed before changing the default value of
WTAVG from 0.5 as it has been used in previous versions of KENO.

.. _fig8-1-201:
.. figure:: figs/Keno/fig201.png
  :align: center
  :width: 600

  Analytic estimate of the relationship between WTAVG and the
  variance, :math:`\sigma^{2}_{k}`, when WTLOW is :sup:`1`/:sub:`6`.

Inside a fissile core, the importance of a neutron is a slowly varying
function in terms of energy and position. Hence, for many systems, the
standard defaults for WTLOW and WTAVG are good values to use. For
reflectors, however, the worth of a neutron varies as a function of
distance from the fissile material and as a function of energy. As a
neutron in the reflector becomes less important relative to a neutron in
the fissile region, it becomes desirable to spend less time tracking it.
Therefore a space- and energy-dependent weighting or biasing function is
used in KENO to allow the user to minimize the variance in k-effective
per unit of tracking time. When a biasing function is used in a
reflector, it becomes possible for a neutron to move from one importance
region into another in which the WTLOW is greater than the weight of the
neutron. When this occurs, Russian roulette is played to reduce the
number of neutrons tracked. When the reverse occurs, that is, when the
neutron moves to a region of higher importance, its weight may be much
higher than WTAVG for that region. When the weight of the neutron is
greater than a preset value, WTHI, the neutron is split into two
neutrons, each having a weight equal to one-half the weight of the
original neutron. This procedure is repeated until the weight of the
split neutron is less than WTHI. The default value for WTHI is
WTAVG*3.0. WTHI is the weight at which splitting occurs.

The weighting or biasing function for a given core material and
reflector material can be obtained by using the adjoint solution from
S\ :sub:`n` type programs for a similar (usually simplified) problem.
This adjoint flux gives the relative contribution of a neutron at a
given energy and position to the total fissions in the system. The
weighting function for KENO is thus proportional to the reciprocal of
the adjoint flux. Although such a function can be difficult to obtain,
the savings gained makes the effort worthwhile for many of the materials
that are frequently used as reflectors. Biasing functions :cite:`odell_transport_1987` have been
prepared for several reflector materials commonly used in KENO
calculations. The use of biasing to minimize the variance in k-effective
per unit of computer time will usually increase the variance in other
parameters such as leakage or absorption in the reflector.

.. _8-1-6-3-4:

Differential albedos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arrays reflected by thick layers of material having a small absorption
to the scattering ratio may require large amounts of computer time to
determine k-effective\ :cite:`demaret_accurate_1999` because of the relatively long time a
history may spend in the reflector. A differential albedo technique was
developed for use with the KENO codes to eliminate tracking in the
reflector. This involves returning a history at the point it impinges on
the reflector and selecting an emergent energy and polar angle from a
joint density function dependent upon the incident energy and polar
angle. The weight of the history is adjusted by the functional return
from the reflector, which is also based on the incident energy and
angle.

The characteristics of a differential albedo emulate the attributes of
the reflector material and are independent of the material or materials
adjacent to the reflector. Thus, a differential albedo that is generated
for a given reflector material can be used with any array, regardless of
the type of fuel or fissile material contained within the array.

For many calculations involving reflected arrays of fissile material,
the differential albedo treatment is a powerful tool that can
significantly reduce the computing time required to determine
k-effective. The savings will vary depending on the importance of the
reflector to the system. A substantial effort is required to generate a
differential albedo, but the savings gained were well worth the effort
for commonly used reflector materials. The savings are not worth the
applicability questions on modern computing platforms; the differential
albedo capability is maintained only for backwards compatibility.

To generate the differential albedo information for a material, a
fixed-source calculation must be made for each incident energy and
angle. The data presently available for use with KENO were generated by
1‑D discrete ordinates calculations for slab geometry representing
infinite slabs. Consequently, for a finite reflector, these data will
not correctly treat histories that enter the reflector near an edge.
Past experience with differential albedo reflectors indicates that
k-effective appears to be conservative for small faces and will tend
toward the correct result as the face becomes large relative to the area
near the corners. Care must be taken to ensure that any surface to which
a differential albedo is applied is large enough that the errors at the
edges can be ignored.

Because differential albedos are expensive and time consuming to
generate, those corresponding to the Hansen-Roach 16-energy-group
structure are the only differential albedos available for use with KENO
at this writing. In the past, their use was limited to problems using
cross sections having the Hansen‑Roach 16-energy-group structure. KENO
extends the use of differential albedos to other energy-group structures
by allowing appropriate energy transfers. This is accomplished by
creating lethargy boundary tables for the albedo group structure and the
cross section group structure and determining the lethargy interval
corresponding to the desired transfer (cross section group structure to
albedo group structure or vice versa) based on a uniform lethargy
distribution over the interval. When the energy-group boundaries of the
cross sections and albedos are different, the results should be
scrutinized by the user to evaluate the effects of the approximations.

Geometry
~~~~~~~~

KENO V.a geometry is restricted to the use of specific shapes. These
shapes are called geometry regions or regions. Allowed shapes in KENO
V.a are cubes, cuboids (rectangular parallelepipeds), spheres,
cylinders, hemispheres, and hemicylinders. These shapes must be oriented
along orthogonal axes and cannot be rotated in KENO V.a. They can be
translated. Hemispheres and hemicylinders are not limited to half
spheres and half cylinders; the definitive plane can be positioned by
entering a chord. The value of this chord can range from the positive
magnitude of the radius (giving a complete sphere or cylinder) to the
negative magnitude of the radius (giving a zero volume, nonexistent
sphere or cylinder).

KENO-VI geometry can model any geometric shape that can be described
using quadratic equations. These geometric shapes are stacked together
forming regions. The set of regions is then used to build units. A set
of predefined shapes that include cones, cuboids (rectangular
parallelepipeds), cylinders, dodecahedrons, ecylinders (extruded
elliptical cylinders), ellipsoids, hexprisms, hoppers, parallelepipeds,
planes, rhombohedrons, spheres, wedges (triangular prisms), as well as
others is used to construct regions. In addition, the keyword
**QUADRATIC** is provided which allows additional shapes to be
constructed by specifying the quadratic equations that describe the
shape. These shapes can be rotated and translated to any orientation and
position within their respective units. Hemispheres and hemicylinders
can be constructed using spheres and cylinders with a chord. Regions are
rotated by providing the nonzero angles associated with the Euler
X-convention.

A major restriction applied to KENO V.a geometry is that intersections
are not allowed. Furthermore, each successive geometry region must
completely enclose the preceding region. Tangency and shared faces are
allowed. The volume of a region is the volume of the specified shape
minus the volume of the preceding region shape and any holes contained
in the region. To alleviate the complete enclosure restriction, KENO V.a
allows multiple sets of geometry regions, with each set independently
governed by this restriction. Each set of these multiple geometry
regions is called a *unit*. Units can be stacked together in a 3-D
rectangular parallelepiped called an *array* or *lattice*, just as
children’s blocks can be stacked. Units that are to be stacked together
in this manner must have a rectangular parallelepiped outer region, and
the adjacent faces of adjacent units must be the same size and shape. An
array can be treated as a building block and used as a unit within
another array.

A major improvement in KENO-VI is the ability to intersect regions.
Region volumes are no longer calculated due to the complexity involved
with intersecting regions. Each set of multiple geometry regions is
called a unit. KENO-VI allows multiple sets of geometry regions (i.e.,
units), and each set has an independent coordinate system. A global unit
must be specified for every problem, including single-unit problems.
Units with cuboidal outer boundaries where the adjoining faces have the
same dimensions can be stacked together in a 3-D rectangular
parallelepiped called an *array* or *lattice*, just as children’s blocks
can be stacked. Unlike KENO V.a, units having hexagonal or dodecahedral
outer boundaries where the adjoining faces have the same dimensions can
also be stacked together in an array. An array boundary must be
specified that either coexists with the outermost edge of the array or
that is entirely within the array. The array boundary can be any shape
that is definable using quadratic equations. An array can be treated as
a building block and used as a unit within another array.

The use of holes in KENO allows a unit to be emplaced within another
unit. This feature allows the addition of a complex structure,
previously defined as a unit, to be directly placed within another unit.
In KENO V.a a hole is not allowed to intersect other holes or regions,
but holes may intersect multiple regions in KENO-VI.

Multiple arrays can be described in KENO. The global array in an
unreflected problem is the outermost array in the problem geometry
description. The global array in a reflected problem is the array
referenced by surrounding geometry regions following the last array
placement description that does not immediately follow a unit number
description. In KENO-VI, the outermost boundary is always specified as
the global unit boundary. If the outermost boundary is to be the array
boundary, a global unit must still be specified with the global unit
boundary coinciding with the array boundary. Unlike past versions of
KENO, KENO-VI cannot run a single unit problem without specifying a
global unit.

Fluxes
~~~~~~

Fluxes are computed in KENO with a track length estimator. The scalar
flux in region \ *z* for energy group *g* for a single generation is
computed as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-85

  \Phi_{g,z} = \frac{\sum^{K}_{k=1}W_{k,z}l_{k,z}}{V_{z}\sum^{K}_{k=1}W_{k,0}} ,

where

   *l*\ :math:`_{k,z}` = distance traversed by particle *k* while within region z
   and energy group *g*,

   *W*\ :math:`_{k,z}` = weight of particle *k* while traversing region *z*,

   *V*\ :math:`_z` = volume of region *z*,

   *W*\ :math:`_{k,0}` = initial weight of particle *k*, and

   *K* = total number of histories in the generation.

The average fluxes for all active generations and the standard deviation
in the averages are also computed. Scaler fluxes computed by KENO are
reported in units of neutrons per cm\ :sup:`2` per initial source
neutron.

KENO is also capable of computing the angular flux for a level symmetric
quadrature set. The angular flux for energy group g in region z for
quadrature direction \ *n* is computed as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-86

  \Phi^{n}_{g,z} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}W_{k,z}l_{k,z,n}}{V_{z}\sum^{K}_{k=1}W_{k,0}} ,

where

   *l*\ :sub:`k,z,n` = the distance traversed by particle \ *k* while within
   region \ *z* and energy group \ *g* within the quadrature
   direction \ *n*.

The angular flux can be expanded to flux moments using an appropriate
spherical harmonics expansion. KENO has even number symmetric level
quadrature sets S\ :sub:`2`\ −S\ :sub:`16`.

Flux moments can also be computed directly in KENO. The *j\ th* moment,
which corresponds to real valued spherical harmonics functions :cite:`demaret_accurate_1999-1` for
a single generation for energy group \ *g* in region \ *z,* is computed
as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-87

    \phi^{j}_{g,z} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}R^{j}_{k}W_{k,z}l_{k,z}}{V_{z}\sum^{K}_{k=1}W_{k,0}} ,

where

   :math:`R^{j}_{k}` = real valued spherical harmonics function for moment index \ *j*
   corresponding to the direction of particle \ *k*.

KENO offers the option of computing the angular fluxes and flux moments
using a transformed coordinate system so that the moments are based on a
polar rather than a Cartesian position vector. This is a 3-D extension
of the 1-D method for calculating the flux moments in terms of Legendre
polynomials based only on the direction cosine with respect to the
spatial coordinate.

This coordinate transform is illustrated in :numref:`fig8-1-193`. Here,
:math:`\hat{i}`, :math:`\hat{j}`, and :math:`\hat{k}`
represent the directional coordinate system axes, µ, η, ξ represent the
direction cosines, and θ and ρ\ represent the polar and
azimuthal angles of the “normal” coordinate system. The same symbols
primed represent the transformed coordinate system. The transformed
polar or :math:`\hat{k}^{'}` axis is co-linear, with the position vector :math:`\vec{r}`
directed from the
center of the region for which moments are desired to the point at which
the flux tally occurs. By using the center of the region as a reference
point, consistency of the moment calculation is assured with differing
models of the same system. The :math:`\hat{i}^{'}` and :math:`\hat{j}^{'}`
axes are chosen to form an
orthogonal coordinate system, with :math:`\hat{i}^{'}` held in the plane formed
by :math:`\hat{i}` and :math:`\hat{j}`. The
use of constraints other than the restriction of :math:`\hat{i}^{'}` to this plane may be
explored in future studies. If an additional constraint is not placed on
either :math:`\hat{i}^{'}` or :math:`\hat{j}^{'}`, the transform would be able to
rotate about :math:`\hat{k}^{'}`, and the
consistency of consecutive transformations of the same direction could
not be assured. With the transform computed, the position and direction
of travel of the particle remain unchanged, but the quadrature
directions and/or spherical harmonics terms are calculated using the
transformed coordinate system. With the direction cosines consistently
transformed for each history, the new polar and azimuthal angles can be
computed and the spherical harmonics functions can be calculated for
each history.

KENO offers a mesh flux tally in which the fluxes are computed in a
user-defined cubic mesh superimposed on the geometry model. The mesh is
defined from the origin of the global unit and is oriented with the
Cartesian axes. At the end of each particle track, appropriate track
lengths are assigned to the mesh intervals that were crossed for the
region in which the track occurred. The length of the actual particle
track is equal to the sum of the lengths assigned to the meshes
encountered by the particle track. Because the coordinates of the mesh
are defined in terms of the global unit, fluxes for regions in repeated
units (i.e., units in arrays or holes) may be stored separately for each
occurrence of the unit. The volumes of each region in each mesh interval
are computed so that the fluxes are appropriately normalized on a per
unit volume basis, consistent with :eq:`eq8-1-85`. When the mesh flux option is
activated, all requested fluxes, scalar, angular and/or moment, are
computed for each mesh interval.

Reaction Rate and Few Group Micro Cross Section Calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few-group microscopic reaction cross section calculation capability is
included in the KENO codes to provide this data especially for the CE
depletion calculations in SCALE. This new method produces multigroup
cross sections and reaction rates directly in CE mode calculations
rather than using a post-processing approach. In each generation, KENO
uses track length estimators for the reaction rate tallies for all
isotopes in each specified regions. At the end of each generation, a
subsequent calculation is performed to compute few group microscopic
reaction cross sections for all isotopes in a region as the ratio of the
computed reaction rates to the flux averaged over this cell. Finally,
KENO computes mean values and statistical uncertainties for all these
quantities, and saves them in a file, which could be used by the
depletion modules in SCALE.

Reaction tally calculations can be enabled by entering the required data
in the **READ REACTION** block described in :ref:`8-1-2-15`.

.. _8-1-6-7:

Source Convergence Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fission source convergence detection techniques are implemented in KENO
to provide improved confidence in the computed *k*\ :sub:`eff` and tally
results. The dominance ratio of a system is equal to the ratio of the
eigenvalue of the first nonfundamental mode to that of the fundamental
mode, *k*\ :sub:`1`\/\ *k*\ :sub:`0`. The dominance ratio is strongly related to the
convergence rate of the fission source for systems, and problems with
larger dominance ratios will require more inactive generations to
produce reliable *k*\ :sub:`eff` and reaction rate estimates. A converged
*k*\ :sub:`eff` estimate does not necessarily guarantee a converged fission
source distribution, and the fission source and flux distribution may
continue to evolve well after *k*\ :sub:`eff` convergence is reached.
Convergence of the fission source distribution is necessary to ensure
that all regions containing fissile material in a model are adequately
represented in the final *k*\ :sub:`eff` estimate. Typically, the *k*\ :sub:`eff`
estimate converges much faster than the fission source and neutron flux
distributions, and simulations may undersample important regions and
produce inaccurate flux and reaction rate estimates if the user includes
only enough inactive generations for the eigenvalue to converge. This is
particularly important in models where one region is physically small
but substantially more reactive than others (i.e. the k-effective of the
World problem :cite:`whitesides_difficulty_1971`). The highly reactive region may not be adequately
sampled, which may result in an underprediction of *k*\ :sub:`eff`. Thus, it is
essential to monitor the convergence of both the fission source
distribution and *k*\ :sub:`eff`; versions of KENO included in SCALE versions
prior to SCALE 6.2 only monitored the convergence of *k*\ :sub:`eff`, but
diagnostic tools to identify unconverged fission source distributions
are included in SCALE 6.2 and beyond.

.. note:: Due to limited experience with these tests in KENO, the
  Shannon entropy test results should be used as a supplement to guarantee
  that a problem’s fission source is converged. Failure of Shannon entropy
  tests typically indicates insufficient convergence of fission site
  source distributions. Whenever Shannon entropy tests report failure,
  users should review the plots of *k*\ :sub:`eff` as a function of generation
  skipped and *k*\ :sub:`eff` as a function of generation completed
  (:ref:`8-1-4-26` and :ref:`8-1-4-27`) to ensure that the *k*\ :sub:`eff` value is adequately
  converged. If it is not clear that the *k*\ :sub:`eff` value is converged,
  users should rerun the calculation using a different number of neutrons
  per generation (using the **NPG** parameter) or using a different random
  number seed value (using the **RND** parameter) or a different starting
  source term distribution (using the **READ START** block). 

It may also be possible to pass the Shannon entropy tests by changing
the source convergence mesh (using the **SCD** parameter and the **READ
GRID** block) or changing the number skipped generations (using the
**NSK** parameter).

 
For KENO calculations that are used for other purposes (such as
producing neutron flux and reaction rate distributions, fuel depletion
calculations, or fission distributions for radiation transport
calculations) in which the spatial dependence of the neutron flux and
fission source may be more important, KENO calculations with failed
Shannon entropy tests should be rerun because these spatially dependent
distributions may not be adequately converged.

Shannon Entropy Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fission source distribution, *S*, is measured at the beginning of
each generation using given spatial meshes. The state of source
distribution at the *j*\ :sup:`th` generation can then be characterized by
Shannon entropy:

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-88

  H(S^{j}) = - \sum^{M}_{i}[S^{j}_{i}\text{log}_{2}(S^{j}_{i})] ,

where :math:`{S}_{i}^{j}` is the fraction of the fission source
distribution from the *j*\ :sup:`th’` generation tallied in the spatial bin
*i*, and *M* is the total number of spatial bins (typically represented
using a spatial mesh). The value of *H* ranges from a maximum value of
log\ :sub:`2`\ *M* when the source distribution is uniform, and to a minimum value of zero
when the whole source is located in a single bin. By computing *H* for
each generation, the distribution of the fission source is used to
generate a score for *H* for each generation, and the convergence of the
fission source can be assessed by tracking the convergence and
randomness of the values of *H* over each successive generation. Random
fluctuations in the generation-to-generation Shannon entropy tallies
make it difficult to determine if and when the Shannon entropy of a
system has converged, so several metrics and tests are typically applied
to examine the Shannon entropy and identify convergence in a
system :cite:`ueki_information_2005`.

The first test for fission source convergence is a comparison between
the mean square of posterior relative entropy, and the centered mean
square Shannon entropy. The posterior relative entropy, :math:`D(S^{j}\parallel T)` , is defined as
the statistical distance between the binned fission source
:math:`{S}^{j}_i`\ and the average fission source over the second half of
the active generations, *T*, and is given by

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-89

  D(S^{j}\parallel T) = \sum^{M}_{i}[S^{j}_{i}\text{log}_{2}(S^{j}_{i} / T_{i})] ,

where *T* is defined by

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-90

  T_{i} = \frac{2}{N}\sum^{N}_{j=N / 2+1}S^{j}_{i} ,

where *N* is the number of active generations. The posterior relative
entropy is non-negative and becomes zero only when :math:`{S}^{j}`\ =  *T*
and achieves its maximum value when :math:`S^{j}` is uniform.

The mean square posterior relative entropy is defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-91

  msq(D) = \frac{2}{N}\sum^{N}_{j=N / 2+1}D(S^{j}_{i}\parallel T_{i})^{2} ,

and the centered mean square Shannon entropy is defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-92

  cmsq(H) = \frac{2}{N-2}\sum^{N}_{j=N / 2+1}[H(S^{j}_{i}) - \bar{H}]^{2} ,

where :math:`\bar{H}` is defined as

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-93

  \bar{H} = \frac{2}{N}\sum^{N}_{j=N / 2+1}H(S^{j}_{i}) .

This test compares the measure of fluctuations of Shannon entropy (*cmsq(H)*)
with the measure of the magnitude of the penalty incurred by assuming *T*
(*msq(D)*) and states that the fission source is converged if *msq(D)* < *cmsq(H)*.
This test is
useful to determine whether the source is converged by the end of the
calculation. Failure of this test indicates that the fission source was
still moving during the active generations, which indicates that the
number of skipped generations was not sufficient to converge the fission
source.

The second test is given by

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-94

  D(S^{j}\parallel T) - [H(T-H(S^{j}))] \leq \varepsilon


where ε has been set to 0.1. This test verifies that the Shannon entropy
of each active generation does not vary significantly from the average
Shannon entropy of the system and should be valid over all active
generations. For example, this test could detect an unconverged fission
source for a problem with an undersampled, highly fissile fuel region,
as any neutrons that reached this region would produce an outlier in the
Shannon entropy tally for that generation. This test is especially
useful for reporting the generation at which the source converged. Once
the converged generation is determined, the user can repeat the
calculation with the number of inactive generations (skipped
generations) set to be the identified generation or greater to ensure
that only contributions from generations with a converged source
contribute to flux and reaction rate tallies. This test complements the
first test since it will not be affected by whether or not the binned
source is uniform.

The last test calculates whether

.. math::
  :label: eq8-1-95

  H_{\eta} = H(S^{j}) - H_{b} \leq \eta ,

where *H*\ :sub:`b` is the average Shannon Entropy over the second half of
active generations, and η has been set to 0.1. This test verifies that
the average Shannon entropy of all active generations does not differ
significantly from the Shannon entropy of the last half of the active
generations. This test is useful for detecting fission source
convergence in problems where an inadequate number of inactive
generations was sampled, as the Shannon entropy would continue to change
during the active generations until it eventually converges.

Source Convergence Diagnostic Input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because the processing of the source tallies for fission source
convergence calculations is quite fast and produces small memory
requirements, these source convergence diagnostics have been permanently
enabled in KENO and require no additional input parameters. However, the
KENO input specifications were updated to allow users to specify the
spatial mesh data for the source convergence tests via the **SCD**
parameter and **READ GRID** data block.
