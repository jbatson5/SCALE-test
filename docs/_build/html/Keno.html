<p>KENO is a three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo criticality transport
program developed and maintained for use as part of the SCALE Code
System. It can be used as part of a sequence or as a standalone program.
There are two versions of the code currently supported in SCALE.
KENO V.a is the older of the two. KENO-VI contains all current KENO V.a
features plus a more flexible geometry package known as the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package. The geometry package in KENO-VI is capable
of modeling any volume that can be constructed using quadratic
equations. In addition, such features as geometry intersections, body
rotations, hexagonal and dodecahedral arrays, and array boundaries have
been included to make the code more flexible.</p>
<p>The simpler geometry features supported by KENO V.a allow for
significantly shorter execution times than KENO-VI, while the additional
geometry features supported in KENO-VI make the code appropriate for
cases where geometry modeling is not possible with KENO V.a. In
particular, KENO-VI allows intersections, body truncations with planes,
and a much wider variety of geometrical bodies. KENO-VI also has the
ability to rotate bodies so that volumes no longer must be positioned
parallel to a major axis. Hexagonal arrays are available in KENO-VI and
dohecahedral arrays enable the code to model pebble bed reactors and
other systems composed of close packed spheres. The use of array
boundaries makes it possible to fill a non-cuboidal volume with an
array, specifying the boundary where a particle leaves and enters the
array.</p>
<p>Except for geometry capabilities, the two versions of KENO share most of
the computational capabilities and the input flexibility specific to
most SCALE modules. They can both operate in multigroup or continuous
energy mode, run as standalone codes, or integrated in computational
sequences such as CSAS, TSUNAMI-3D, or TRITON. Both versions of the code
are continually updated and are written in FORTRAN 90.</p>
<p>Computational capabilities shared by the two versions of KENO include
the determination of k‑effective, neutron lifetime, generation time,
energy-dependent leakages, energy- and region-dependent absorptions,
fissions, the system mean-free-path, the region-dependent
mean-free-path, average neutron energy, flux densities, fission
densities, reaction rate tallies, mesh tallies, source convergence
diagnostics, problem-dependent continuous energy temperature treatments,
parallel calculations, restart capabilities, and many more.</p>

<p>Many individuals have contributed significantly to the development of
KENO. Special recognition is given to G. E. Whitesides, former Director
of the Computing Applications Division, who was responsible for the
concept and development of the original KENO code. He has also
contributed significantly to some of the techniques used in both KENO
versions. The late J. T. Thomas offered many ideas that have been
implemented in the code. R. M. Westfall, retired from ORNL, provided
early consultation, encouragement, and benchmarks for validating the
code. The special abilities of J. R. Knight, retired from ORNL,
contributed substantially to debugging early versions of the code. S. W.
D. Hart was instrumental in implementing continuous energy temperature
treatments. W. J. Marshall has provided substantial validation and
quality assurance reviews. Appreciation is expressed to C. V. Parks and
S. M. Bowman for their support of KENO and the KENO3D visualization
tool. The late P. B. Fox provided many of the figures in this document.
D. Ilas, B. J. Marshall, and D. E. Mueller consolidated the previous
KENO V.a and KENO-VI manuals into this present form. The efforts of
L. F. Norris (retired), W. C. Carter (retired), S. J. Poarch, D. J.
Weaver (retired), S. Y. Walker and R. B. Raney in preparing this
document are gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<h2>Introduction to KENO<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-keno" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KENO, a functional module in the SCALE system, is a Monte Carlo
criticality program used to calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{eff}\)</span>, fluxes, reaction rates,
and other data for three-dimensional (3-D) systems. Special features
include multigroup or continuous energy mode, simplified data input, the
ability to specify origins for spherical and cylindrical geometry
regions, a P<sub>n</sub> scattering treatment, and restart capability.</p>
<p>The KENO data input features flexibility in the order of input. The only
restrictions are that the sequence identifier, title, and cross section
library must be entered first. A large portion of the data has been
assigned default values found to be adequate for many
problems. This feature enables the user to run a problem with a minimum
of input data.</p>
<p>In addition to the features listed above, KENO-VI uses the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package (SGGP), which contains a much larger set of
geometrical bodies, including cuboids, cylinders, spheres, cones,
dodecahedrons, elliptical cylinders, ellipsoids, hoppers,
parallelepipeds, planes, rhomboids, and wedges. The code’s flexibility
is increased by allowing: intersecting geometry regions; hexagonal,
dodecahedral, and cuboidal arrays; bodies and holes rotated to any angle
and translated to any position; and a specified array boundary that
contains only that portion of the array located inside the boundary.
Users should be aware that the added geometry features in KENO‑VI can
result in significantly longer run times than KENO V.a. A KENO-VI
problem that can be modeled in KENO V.a will typically run about four
times as long with KENO-VI as it does with KENO V.a. Therefore KENO-VI
is not a replacement for KENO V.a, but rather an additional version for
more complex geometries that could not be modeled previously.</p>
<p>Blocks of input data are entered in the form</p>
<p><strong>READ XXXX</strong> <em>input_data</em> <strong>END XXXX,</strong></p>
<p>where <strong>XXXX</strong> is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
types of data entered include parameters, geometry region data, array
definition data, biasing or weighting data, albedo boundary conditions,
starting distribution information, the cross section mixing table, extra
one-dimensional (1-D) (reaction rate) cross section IDs for special
applications, energy group boundaries for tallying in the continuous
energy mode, a mesh grid for collecting flux moments, and printer plot
information.</p>
<p>A block of data can be omitted unless it is needed or desired for the
problem. Within the blocks of data, most of the input is activated by
using keywords to override default values.</p>
<p>The treatment of the energy variable can be either multigroup or
continuous. Changing the calculation mode from multigroup to continuous
energy or vice versa is established by simply changing the cross section
library used. All available calculated entities in the multigroup mode
can also be calculated in the continuous energy mode. If the calculated
entity is energy or group dependent, it is automatically tallied into
the appropriate group structure in the continuous energy mode.</p>
<p>The KENO V.a geometry input consists of spheres, hemispheres, cylinders,
hemicylinders, and cuboids. Although the origin of the cylinders,
hemicylinders, spheres, and hemispheres is zero by default, they may be
specified to any value that will allow the geometry to fit in the
problem. This feature allows the use of nonconcentric cylindrical and
spherical shapes and provides a great deal of freedom in positioning
them. Another feature that expands the generality of the code is the
ability to place the cut surface of the hemicylinders and hemispheres at
any distance between the radius and the origin.</p>
<p>An additional convenience is the availability of an alternative method
for specifying the array definition unit-location data. This method uses
FIDO-like options for filling the array.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, KENO-VI uses the SGGP, which contains a much more
flexible geometry package than the one in KENO V.a. In KENO-VI, geometry
regions are constructed and processed as sets of quadratic equations. A
set of geometric shapes (including all of those used in KENO V.a plus
others) is available in KENO-VI, as well as the ability to build more
complex geometric shapes using sets of quadratic equations. Unlike
KENO V.a, KENO-VI allows intersections between geometry regions within a
unit, and it provides the ability to specify an array boundary that
intersects the array.</p>
<p>The most flexible KENO V.a geometry features are the
“<strong>ARRAY</strong>-of-<strong>ARRAY</strong>s” and “<strong>HOLE</strong>s” capabilities. The
<strong>ARRAY</strong>-of-<strong>ARRAY</strong>s option allows the construction of <strong>ARRAY</strong>s
from other <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. The depth of nesting is limited only by
computer space restrictions. This option greatly simplifies the setup
for <strong>ARRAY</strong>s involving different <strong>UNIT</strong>s at different spacings.
The <strong>HOLE</strong> option allows a <strong>UNIT</strong> or an <strong>ARRAY</strong> to be placed at
any desired location within a geometry region. The emplaced <strong>UNIT</strong> or
<strong>ARRAY</strong> cannot intersect any geometry region and must be wholly
contained within a region. As many <strong>HOLE</strong>s as will snugly fit
without intersecting can be placed in a region. This option is
especially useful for describing shipping casks and reflectors that have
gaps or other geometrical features. Any number of <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be
described in a problem, and <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be nested to any depth.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the KENO V.a and KENO-VI geometry input
is the methodology used to represent the geometry/material regions in a
unit. KENO-VI uses two geometry records (cards) to describe a region.
The first record, called the GEOMETRY record, contains the geometry
(<strong>shape</strong>) keyword, region boundary definitions, and any geometry
modification data. Using geometry modification data, regions can be
rotated and translated to any angle and position within a unit. The
second record, the <strong>CONTENT</strong> record, contains the <strong>MEDIA</strong> keyword;
the material, <strong>HOLE</strong>, or <strong>ARRAY</strong> ID number; the bias ID number; and
the region definition vector. KENO-VI requires that a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> be
specified in all problems, including single unit problems.</p>
<p>In addition to the <em>cuboidal</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s available in KENO V.a,
<em>hexagonal</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <em>dodecahedral</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be directly
constructed in KENO-VI. Also, the ability to specify an <strong>ARRAY</strong>
boundary that intersects the <strong>ARRAY</strong> makes it possible to construct a
lattice in a cylinder using one <strong>ARRAY</strong> in KENO-VI instead of multiple
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <strong>HOLE</strong>s as would be required in KENO V.a.</p>
<p>Anisotropic scattering is treated by using discrete scattering angles.
The angles and associated probabilities are generated in a manner that
preserves the moments of the angular scattering distribution for the
selected group-to-group transfer. These moments can be derived from the
coefficients of a P<sub>n</sub> Legendre polynomial expansion. All moments
through the 2n − 1 moment are preserved for n discrete scattering
angles. A one-to-one correspondence exists such that n Legendre
coefficients yield n moments. The cases of zero and one scattering angle
are treated in a special manner. Even when the user specifies multiple
scattering angles, KENO can recognize that the distribution is
isotropic, and therefore KENO selects from a continuous isotropic
distribution. If the user specifies one scattering angle, the code
selects the scattering angle from a linear function if it is positive
between -1 and +1, and otherwise it performs semicontinuous scattering
by picking scattering angle cosines uniformly over some range between –1
and +1. The probability is zero over the rest of the range.</p>
<p>The KENO restart option is easy to activate. Certain changes can be made
when a problem is restarted, including using a different random sequence
or turning off certain print options such as fluxes or the fissions and
absorptions by region.</p>
<p>KENO can also compute angular fluxes and flux moments in multigroup
calculations, which are required to compute scattering terms for
generation of sensitivity coefficients with the SAMS module or the
TSUNAMI-3D control module. Fluxes can also be accumulated in a Cartesian
mesh that is superimposed over the user-defined geometry in an automated
manner.</p>
<p>KENO can perform Monte Carlo transport calculations concurrently on a
number of computational nodes. By introducing a simple master-slave
approach via MPI, KENO runs different random walks concurrently on the
replicated geometry within the same generation. Fission source and other
tallied quantities are gathered at the end of each generation by the
master process and are then processed either for final edits or
subsequent generations. Code parallel performance is strongly dependent
on the size of the problem simulated and the size of the tallied
quantities.</p>

<p>KENO may be run stand alone or as part of a SCALE criticality safety or
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sequence. If KENO is run stand
alone in the multigroup mode, cross section data can be used from an
AMPX <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="#dunn-ampx-2000-2002" id="id1">[DG02]</a> working format library or from a Monte Carlo format cross
section library. If KENO uses an AMPX working format library, a mixing
table data block must be entered. If a Monte Carlo format library is
used, a mixing table data block is not entered, and the mixtures
specified in the KENO geometry description must be consistent with the
mixtures created on the Monte Carlo format library file.</p>
<p>If KENO is run stand alone in the continuous energy mode, a mixing table
data block must be provided unless the restart option is used.</p>
<p>If KENO is run as part of a SCALE criticality safety or sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis sequence, the mixtures are defined in the CSAS or
TSUNAMI-3D input, and a mixing table data block cannot be entered in
KENO. Furthermore, the mixture numbers used in the KENO geometry
description must correspond to those defined in the composition data
block of the CSAS or TSUNAMI-3D input. To use a cell-weighted mixture in
KENO, the keyword “<strong>CELLMIX</strong>=,” followed by a unique mixture
number, must be specified in the unit cell data of the CSAS or
TSUNAMI‑3D sequence. Unit cell data are applicable only in the
multigroup mode. The mixture number used in the KENO input is the unique
mixture number immediately following the keyword “<strong>CELLMIX</strong>=.” A
cell‑weighted mixture is available only in SCALE sequences that use
XSDRN to perform a cell-weighting calculation using a multigroup cross
section library. <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-1"><span class="std std-numref">Table 30</span></a> through <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-14"><span class="std std-numref">Table 43</span></a> summarize the KENO
input data blocks. These input data blocks are discussed in detail in
the following sections.</p>
<p>In order to run KENO parallel (standalone execution), the user must
provide a name with the “%” prefix in the input file (=%kenovi). Control
modules like CSAS, TRITON, and TSUNAMI-3D automatically initiate
parallel KENO execution if the user provides the required arguments

<p>Three data records <strong>must</strong> be entered for every problem: first the
SCALE sequence identifier, then the problem title, and then the <strong>END
DATA</strong> to terminate the problem.</p>
<p>(1) KENO is typically run using one of the SCALE CSAS or TSUNAMI
sequences, but it may also be run stand alone using KENO V.a or KENO-VI.
The sequence identifier is specified using one line similar to:</p>
<p>=kenovi</p>
<p>This line may also include additional runtime directives that are
described throughout the SCALE manual. For example:</p>
<p>=kenova parm=check</p>
<p>The following guidance generally assumes the user is running KENO stand
alone. If KENO is to be run using of the other sequences (e.g., CSAS5),
see the appropriate manual section for additional guidance.</p>

<p>The option to define multiple spatial meshes during a single simulation
has been implemented in the KENO codes to add flexibility to mesh-based
quantity calculations. The new implementation requires that each mesh

<p>To support these former and new definition formats, the parameters
<strong>SCD</strong>, <strong>CDS</strong>, <strong>GFX</strong>, <strong>MFX</strong> and <strong>CGD</strong> have been redesigned to

multiple mesh-based quantities are requested by the user. In this case,
each integer entry must point to a grid ID specified in any <strong>READ

<p>The <em>GEOMETRY_ DATA</em> consists of a series of <strong>UNIT</strong> descriptions, one
of which may be the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>. The <strong>UNIT</strong> is the basic geometry
piece in KENO and often corresponds to a well-defined physical entity
(e.g., a fuel pin). A <strong>UNIT</strong>, therefore, may consist of multiple
<em>material regions</em>. Each <strong>UNIT</strong> has its own, local coordinate system.
The <strong>UNIT</strong>s are assembled to construct the problem’s global geometry
for KENO. The <em>GEOMETRY_ DATA</em> must be entered unless the problem is
being restarted. See <a class="reference internal" href="#id34"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry</span></a> for detailed examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="units">
<h4>UNITS<a class="headerlink" href="#units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Geometric arrangements in KENO are achieved in a manner similar to using
a child’s building blocks. Each building block is called a <strong>UNIT</strong>. An
<strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice is constructed by stacking these <strong>UNIT</strong>s. Once
an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice has been constructed, it can be placed in a
<strong>UNIT</strong> by using an <strong>ARRAY</strong> specification.</p>
<p>Each <strong>UNIT</strong> in an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice has its own coordinate system.
In KENO V.a, all coordinate systems in all <strong>UNIT</strong>s must have the
same orientation. This restriction is removed in KENO-VI. All geometry
data used in a problem are correlated to the absolute coordinate system
by specifying a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>. <strong>UNIT</strong>s are constructed of
combinations from several allowed <strong>shape</strong>s or geometric regions.
These regions can be placed anywhere within a <strong>UNIT</strong>. In KENO V.a the
regions are oriented along the coordinate system of the <strong>UNIT</strong> and do
not intersect other regions. This means, for example, that a
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> must have its axis parallel to one of the coordinate axes,
while a rectangular parallelepiped must have its faces perpendicular to
a coordinate axis. The most stringent KENO V.a geometry restriction is
that none of the options allow geometry regions to intersect. In KENO
V.a, each region in a unit must entirely contain each preceding region.
The orientation, intersection, and containment restrictions are
eliminated in KENO-VI. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-1"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 55</span></a> shows some situations that are not
allowed in KENO V.a, but are allowed in KENO-VI.</p>

</div>
<p>For KENO V.a, unless special options are invoked, each geometric region
in a <strong>UNIT</strong> must completely enclose each interior region. Regions may
touch at points of tangency and may share faces. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 56</span></a> for
examples of allowable situations.</p>

</div>
<p>Special options are provided to circumvent the complete enclosure
restriction in KENO V.a or to enhance the basic geometry package in
KENO-VI. These options include <strong>ARRAY</strong> and <strong>HOLE</strong> descriptions. The
<strong>HOLE</strong> option is the simplest of these and allows placing a <strong>UNIT</strong>
anywhere within a region of another <strong>UNIT.</strong> In KENO V.a, <strong>HOLE</strong>s
are not allowed to intersect the region into which they are placed; this
restriction does not apply in KENO-VI (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 57</span></a>). In both geometry
packages, a <strong>HOLE</strong> cannot intersect the <strong>UNIT</strong> boundary. It is
recommended that the outer boundary of a <strong>UNIT</strong> used as a <strong>HOLE</strong>
should not be tangent to or share a boundary with another <strong>HOLE</strong> or a
region of the <strong>UNIT</strong> containing the <strong>HOLE</strong> because the code may find
that the regions are intersecting due to precision and round-off. Since
a particle must check every region to determine its location within a
<strong>UNIT</strong>, using <strong>HOLE</strong>s to contain complex sections of a problem may
decrease the CPU time needed for the problem in KENO-VI. Inclusion of
<strong>HOLE</strong>s increases run-time in KENO V.a, but in many cases cannot be
avoided. An arbitrary number of <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be placed in a region in
combination with a series of surrounding regions. The only restrictions
on <strong>HOLE</strong>s are (1) when they are placed in a <strong>UNIT,</strong> they must be
entirely contained within the <strong>UNIT</strong>, and (2) they cannot intersect
other <strong>HOLE</strong>s or nested <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. <strong>HOLE</strong>s in KENO V.a cannot
intersect an <strong>ARRAY</strong>; in KENO-VI, the <strong>HOLE</strong> cannot intersect the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary.</p>

<p>Lattices or arrays are created by stacking <strong>UNIT</strong>s. In KENO V.a,
only rectangular parallelepipeds can be organized in an <strong>ARRAY</strong>.
<strong>HEXPRISM</strong>s and <strong>DODECAHEDRON</strong>s are allowed in KENO-VI to
construct triangular pitched or closed-packed dodecahedral <strong>ARRAY</strong>s,
respectively. The adjacent faces of adjacent <strong>UNIT</strong>s stacked in this
manner must match exactly. See <span class="xref std std-ref">8-1-3-6-4</span> for additional

<p>The <strong>ARRAY</strong> option is provided to allow for placing an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or
lattice within a <strong>UNIT</strong>. In KENO-VI, an <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed in a
<strong>UNIT</strong> by inserting it directly into a geometry/material region as a
content record. In KENO V.a, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed directly in the
unit like a <strong>CUBOID</strong>: it must be the first region in the <strong>UNIT</strong>, or
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> elements must intersect with the smaller region.
Subsequent regions in the <strong>UNIT</strong> containing the <strong>ARRAY</strong> must contain
it entirely. In KENO-VI, the reverse is true: the region boundary
containing the <strong>ARRAY</strong> must coincide with or be contained within the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary. Therefore, in KENO-VI the region boundary becomes
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary, with the problem ignoring any part of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> outside the boundary. A particle enters or leaves the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> when the region boundary is crossed. In KENO V.a, only one
<strong>ARRAY</strong> can be placed directly in a UNIT. However, multiple
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be placed within a <strong>UNIT</strong> by using <strong>HOLE</strong>s. When
an <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed in a <strong>UNIT</strong> via a <strong>HOLE</strong>, the <strong>UNIT</strong> that
contains the <strong>ARRAY</strong> (rather than the <strong>ARRAY</strong> itself) is placed in
the <strong>UNIT</strong>. <strong>ARRAY</strong>s of dissimilar <strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be created by
stacking <strong>UNIT</strong>s that contain <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. In KENO-VI, it is
possible to place multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s in a <strong>UNIT</strong> by placing them in
separate regions. Also in KENO-VI, using <strong>HOLE</strong>s to insert
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s allows the <strong>ARRAY</strong>s to be rotated when placed. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-6"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 60</span></a> for an example of an <strong>ARRAY</strong> composed of <strong>UNIT</strong>s
containing <strong>HOLE</strong>s and <strong>ARRAY</strong>s.</p>

<p>The <strong>UNIT</strong> <em>INITIALIZATION</em> has the following format:</p>

it may be used in an <strong>ARRAY</strong> (see below for more details).</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL</strong> is an attribute that specifies that the respective <strong>UNIT</strong>
is the most comprehensive <strong>UNIT</strong> in the KENO problem to be solved, the
<strong>UNIT</strong> that includes all the other <strong>UNIT</strong>s and defines the overall
geometric boundaries of the problem. In general, a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>
must be entered for each problem.</p>

<div><p>In KENO V.a, the <strong>GLOBAL</strong> specification is optional. If it is used,
it can precede either a <strong>UNIT</strong> command or an <strong>ARRAY</strong>

UNIT</strong>. If there is no <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> specified and <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 is
absent from the geometry description, an error message is printed. If
the geometry description contains an <strong>ARRAY</strong>, KENO V.a defaults the
global array to the array referenced by the last <strong>ARRAY</strong>

<p>For each <strong>UNIT</strong>, the <strong>UNIT</strong>’s <em>DESCRIPTION</em> follows the

combining the commands listed below. The basic principles for
constructing a <strong>UNIT</strong> are different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. A
brief discussion of these principles, together with a few examples, is
presented at the end of this section following the description of the
basic input used to build the geometry of a <strong>UNIT</strong>. The keywords that
may be used to define a <strong>UNIT</strong> in KENO are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong></p>
<p><strong>COM=</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOLE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARRAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>REPLICATE</strong> (KENO V.a only)</p>
<p><strong>REFLECTOR</strong> (KENO V.a only)</p>
<p><strong>MEDIA</strong> (KENO-VI only)</p>
<p><strong>BOUNDARY</strong> (KENO-VI only)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shape">
<h5>Shape<a class="headerlink" href="#shape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p><strong>Shape</strong> is a generic keyword used to describe a basic geometric shape
that may be used in building the geometry of a particular <strong>UNIT</strong>. The
general format varies between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, the
<strong>shape</strong> defines a region containing a material, so the user is
required to provide both a material and a <em>bias ID</em>. In KENO-VI the
<strong>shape</strong> is used strictly as a surface, which is later used to define
the mono-material regions (using the <strong>MEDIA</strong> card). The user is
therefore required to enter a label for this surface so that the
<strong>shape</strong> can be referenced later.</p>
<p>KENO V.a:</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong> <em>m</em> <em>b</em> <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>d</em><sub>N</sub> [<em>a</em><sub>1</sub> …* [<em>a</em><sub>M</sub> ]…]</p>
<p>KENO-VI:</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong> <em>l</em> <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>d</em><sub>N</sub> [<em>a</em><sub>1</sub> …* [<em>a</em><sub>M</sub> ]…]</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong> is a generic keyword that describes a basic predefined KENO
shape (e.g., <strong>CUBOID</strong>, <strong>CYLINDER</strong>) that is used to build the
geometry of the <strong>UNIT</strong>. The predefined shapes differ between KENO V.a
and KENO-VI. See Appendix A for a description of the KENO V.a basic
shapes and Appendix B for the KENO-VI shapes.</p>
<p><em>m</em> is the mixture number of the material (positive integer) that fills
the particular shape in KENO V.a <strong>UNIT</strong> description. A material number
of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present in the
volume defined by the <strong>shape</strong>).</p>
<p><em>b</em> is the bias identification number (<em>bias ID</em>, a positive integer)
assigned to the particular region defined by the <strong>shape</strong> in the KENO
V.a <strong>UNIT</strong> description.</p>
<p><em>l</em> is the label (positive integer) assigned to the particular <strong>shape</strong>
in the KENO-VI <strong>UNIT</strong> description. This label is used later to define
a certain mono-material region within the <strong>UNIT</strong>.</p>
<p><em>d</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>d</em><sub>N</sub> represent the <em>N</em> dimensions (floating point numbers) that
define the particular <strong>shape</strong> (e.g., radius of a sphere or cylinder).
See Appendixes A and B for the particular value of <em>N</em> and how each
<strong>shape</strong> is described.</p>
<p><em>a</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>a</em><sub>M</sub> are <em>M</em> optional <em>ATTRIBUTES</em> for the <strong>shape</strong>. The
attributes provide additional flexibility in the <strong>shape</strong> description.
The attributes that may be used with either KENO V.a or KENO-VI are
described below (see shape ATTRIBUTES).</p>
<p>shape ATTRIBUTES</p>
<p>The <em>ATTRIBUTES</em> that can be used to enhance the <strong>shape</strong> description
are <strong>CHORD</strong>, <strong>ORIG</strong>[<strong>IN</strong>], <strong>CENTER</strong>, and <strong>ROTATE</strong> (KENO-VI
only).</p>
<p>The CHORD attribute</p>
<p>This attribute has different formats in KENO V.a and KENO-VI. The user
will notice that it is more restrictive in KENO V.a. Only the
<strong>HEMISPHERE and HEMICYLINDER shape</strong>s can be <strong>CHORD</strong>ed in KENO
V.a, but all 3-D shapes may be <strong>CHORD</strong>ed in KENO-VI.</p>
<p>KENO V.a:
<strong>CHORD</strong> <em>ρ</em></p>
<p>KENO-VI:
<strong>CHORD</strong> [<strong>+X</strong>=<em>x+</em>] [-<strong>X</strong>=<em>x-</em>] [<strong>+Y</strong>=<em>y+</em>]
[-<strong>Y</strong>=<em>y-</em>] [<strong>+Z</strong>=<em>z+</em>] [-<strong>Z</strong>=<em>z-</em>]</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span></dt><dd><p>is the distance <em>ρ</em> from the cut surface to the center of the sphere
or the axis of a hemicylinder. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-7"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 61</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-8"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 62</span></a>. Negative
values of <em>ρ</em> indicate that less than half of the <strong>shape</strong> is retained,
while positive values indicate that more than half of the <strong>shape</strong> will
be retained.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>+X=</strong>, -<strong>X=</strong>, <strong>+Y=</strong>, -<strong>Y=</strong>, <strong>+Z=</strong>, -<strong>Z=</strong></dt><dd><p>are subordinate
keywords that define the axis parallel to the chord. The “+” and “-”
signs are used to define the side of the chord which is included in the
volume. A “+” in the keyword indicates that the more positive side of
the chord is included in the volume. A “-” in the keyword indicates that
the more negative side of the chord is included in the volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>x+, x-, y+, y-, z+, z-</em></dt><dd><p>are the coordinates of the plane
perpendicular to the chord. For each chord added to a body, the keyword
<strong>CHORD</strong> must be used, followed by one of the subordinate keywords and
its dimension.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In KENO V.a, the CHORD attribute is applicable for only hemispherical
and hemicylindrical shapes, <em>not</em> for SPHERE, XCYLINDER, YCYLINDER,
CYLINDER, ZCYLINDER, CUBE, or CUBOID.</p>

<p>The ORIG[IN] attribute</p>
<p>The format is slightly different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. Since the
entries in KENO-VI are key worded, the user has more flexibility in
choosing the order of these entries or in using default values. Only
non-zero values must be entered in KENO-VI, but all applicable values,
whether zero or non-zero, must be entered in KENO V.a.</p>
<p>KENO V.a:

<p>The CENTER attribute</p>
<p>This attribute establishes the reference center for the flux moment

<p>The ROTATE attribute</p>
<p>This attribute can only be used in the KENO-VI input. It allows for the
rotation of the <strong>shape</strong> or <strong>HOLE</strong> to which it is applied. If
<strong>ORIGIN</strong> and <strong>ROTATE</strong> data follow the same <strong>shape</strong> or <strong>HOLE</strong>
record, the <strong>shape</strong> is always rotated prior to translation, regardless
of the order in which the data appear. Fig. 8.1.10 provides an example
of the use of the <strong>ROTATE</strong> option. Its syntax is:</p>
<p><strong>ROTATE</strong> [<strong>A1</strong>=<em>a</em><sub>1</sub>] [<strong>A2</strong>=<em>a</em><sub>2</sub>] [<strong>A3</strong>=<em>a</em><sub>3</sub>]</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>A1</strong>=, <strong>A2</strong>=, <strong>A3</strong>=</dt><dd><p>are subordinate keywords to specify the

<h5>ARRAY<a class="headerlink" href="#array" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When used within a <strong>UNIT</strong> description, this entry provides an
<strong>ARRAY</strong> placement description. In KENO V.a, it always starts a new
<strong>UNIT</strong> and generates a rectangular parallelepiped that fits the outer
boundaries of the specified <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The specified <strong>ARRAY</strong> is
positioned in the <strong>UNIT</strong> according to the most negative point in the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> with respect to the coordinate system of the surrounding
<strong>UNIT</strong>. Thus, the location of the minimum x, minimum y, and minimum z
point in the array is specified in the coordinate system of the <strong>UNIT</strong>
into which the <strong>ARRAY</strong> is being placed.</p>
<p>In KENO-VI, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> keyword is used to position an <strong>ARRAY</strong>
within a region in a surrounding <strong>UNIT</strong> relative to the origin of the
surrounding <strong>UNIT</strong>. When the subordinate keyword <strong>PLACE</strong> is entered,
it is followed by six numbers that precisely locate the <strong>ARRAY</strong> within
the surrounding <strong>UNIT</strong> as shown in the example below. The first three
numbers consist of the element in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> of the <strong>UNIT</strong> selected
to position the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The next three numbers consist of the
position of the origin of the selected <strong>UNIT</strong> in the surrounding
<strong>UNIT</strong>. Higher level <strong>ARRAY</strong> boundaries may intersect lower level
<strong>ARRAY</strong> boundaries as long as they do not intersect <strong>HOLE</strong>s in the
<strong>UNIT</strong>s contained in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> or in <strong>UNIT</strong>s contained in
lower level <strong>ARRAY</strong>s.</p>
<p>The syntax for the <strong>ARRAY</strong> card is as follows:</p>

<h5>REPLICATE and REFLECTOR<a class="headerlink" href="#replicate-and-reflector" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>These keywords specific to KENO V.a are used to generate additional
geometry regions having the <strong>shape</strong> of the previous region. The
geometry keyword <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> is a synonym for <strong>REPLICATE</strong>. The
desired weighting functions can be applied to those regions by
specifying biasing data as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#id12"><span class="std std-ref">Biasing or weighting data</span></a>. The total
thickness generated for each surface is the thickness per region for
that surface times the number of regions to be generated, <em>nreg</em>.</p>
<p>The replicate specification is frequently used to generate weighting
regions external to an <strong>ARRAY</strong> placement description. Thus an
<strong>ARRAY</strong> placement description followed by a <strong>REPLICATE</strong> description
would generate regions of a cuboidal shape. A cylindrical reflector
could be generated by following the <strong>ARRAY</strong> placement description with
a <strong>CYLINDER</strong> and then a <strong>REPLICATE</strong>. A <strong>HOLE</strong> cannot immediately
follow a <strong>REPLICATE</strong>.</p>
<p>Extra regions using default weights can be generated by specifying the
first importance region, <em>imp</em>, to be one that was not defined in the
<em>BIASING INFORMATION</em> provided in a <strong>READ BIAS</strong> block. This capability
can be used to generate extra regions for collecting information such as
fluxes, leakage, etc.</p>
<p>Multiple replicate descriptions can be used in any problem. This
capability can be used to model different reflector materials of
different thicknesses on different faces.</p>
<p>The number of appropriate region dimensions needed for specifying
<strong>REPLICATE</strong> is determined by the preceding region. For example, if the
previous region were a <strong>SPHERE</strong>, one entry (i.e., <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>) would be
required. If the previous region were a <strong>CYLINDER</strong>, the first entry,
<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>, would be the thickness/region in the radial direction, the
second entry, <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>, would the thickness/region in the positive length
direction, the third entry, <em>t</em><sub>3</sub>, would be the thickness/region in the
negative length direction, etc. The <strong>REPLICATE</strong> specification
requirements for a <strong>CUBE</strong> are the same as for a <strong>CUBOID</strong>.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p><strong>REPLICATE|REFLECTOR</strong> <em>m</em> <em>b</em> <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>t</em><sub>N</sub> <em>nreg</em></p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><em>m</em></dt><dd><p>is the number of the material (non-negative integer) that fills the
particular REPLICATE/REFLECTOR region in the <strong>UNIT</strong> description. A
material of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present
in the volume defined by the <strong>shape</strong>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>b</em></dt><dd><p>is the bias identification number (positive integer) assigned to the
particular region defined by the <strong>shape</strong> in the KENO V.a <strong>UNIT</strong>
description. If the specified bias ID is defined in a <strong>READ BIAS</strong>
block, the bias ID number will be incremented automatically, increasing
one for each additional region up to <em>nreg</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>t</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>t</em><sub>N</sub></dt><dd><p>represent the thickness (floating point number) per region
for each of the <em>N</em> surfaces that define the particular <strong>shape</strong>. If
the specified bias ID is one that is defined in the READ BIAS block, the

generate the bias data being used. See <span class="xref std std-ref">9-1-2-7</span>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

other <strong>UNIT</strong> numbers in their proper places. An example showing the
use of the <strong>LOOP</strong> option is given below. This 5 × 4 × 3 <strong>ARRAY</strong> of

<span id="id11"></span><h3>Albedo data<a class="headerlink" href="#albedo-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Albedo boundary conditions are entered by assigning an albedo condition
to each face of the outermost boundary. The <strong>default value for each
face is vacuum</strong>. The default values are overridden only on faces for
which other albedo names are specified. Albedo boundary conditions are
applied <strong>only</strong> to <strong>the outermost region of a problem.</strong> In KENO V.a
this geometry region must be a rectangular parallelepiped. The outer
boundary can be any <strong>shape</strong> (or combination of <strong>shape</strong>s) in
KENO-VI. Material-specific albedos (e.g., H2O and CONC) may not be used
in continuous energy calculations.</p>
<p>KENO-VI users need to be aware that when a neutron reaches a surface
with a vacuum albedo, that neutron is lost. If a model contains features
that are reentrant, that is a neutron could exit the model and reenter
the model on the other side of an unmodeled region, all neutrons passing
through the problem boundary are lost when they reach the unmodeled
region. Neutrons are not “transported” across unmodeled areas between
reentrant surfaces. It is not possible to create a KENO V.a model with
reentrant problem outer boundary surfaces.</p>
<p>The syntax for entering the albedo boundary conditions is:</p>
<p><strong>READ BOUNDS</strong> <strong>fc</strong><sub>1</sub>=<em>a</em><sub>1</sub> [<strong>fc</strong><sub>2</sub>=<em>a</em><sub>2</sub>…
[<strong>fc</strong><sub>N</sub>=<em>a</em><sub>N</sub> ]…] <strong>END BOUNDS</strong></p>
<p><strong>fc</strong><sub>1</sub> … <strong>fc</strong><sub>N</sub> are <strong>N</strong> face codes as defined in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-18"><span class="std std-numref">Table 47</span></a>.</p>
<p><em>a</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>a</em><sub>N</sub> are the albedo types as defined in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Table 48</span></a></p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Table 48</span></a> lists some material-specific albedo sets. Care must be
exercised when using material-specific albedo types. These data sets
were generated using a real problem, and they implicitly reflect the
neutron energy spectrum, materials, and geometry from that model. Where
neutron energy spectra, materials, and geometry vary from that model,
the material-specific albedos may give significantly incorrect results.
This may be checked by comparing results from a sample of calculations
performed with both explicitly modeled reflectors and material-specific
albedos. In general, use of material-specific albedos is not
recommended.</p>

<p>The <strong>BODY</strong> and <strong>SURFACE</strong> keywords are unique to KENO-VI. The face
code <strong>BODY</strong>= refers to the body label in global unit input. For
example, assume the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> boundary record in a KENO-VI input
consisted of the following: <strong>BOUNDARY</strong> 10 −30 20. In this case
<strong>BODY</strong>=10 would refer to the geometry record labeled 10,
<strong>BODY</strong>=20 would refer to the geometry record labeled 20, and
<strong>BODY</strong>=30 would refer to the geometry record labeled 30. All surface
numbers following the <strong>BODY</strong> keyword apply to that body. The default
value of <strong>BODY</strong> is the first geometry label listed in the <strong>GLOBAL
UNIT</strong> boundary record.</p>
<p>All the face codes, listed in the first part of <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-18"><span class="std std-numref">Table 47</span></a>, except
<strong>BODY</strong>= and <strong>SURFACE</strong>(ii)= were intended to apply only to
cuboids (KENO V.a). However, when used with non-cuboidal surfaces
(KENO-VI) they will fill in the first six surface positions of a body in
the following order, +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z. The <strong>ALL</strong> face code will
apply the listed boundary conditions to all surfaces of the body
currently being considered.</p>
<p>Albedo boundary conditions may be entered on each <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>
boundary surface multiple times. The boundary condition that applies to
the surface is the last one entered. If no boundary data are entered or
if no albedo boundary condition is applied to a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> boundary
surface, then the boundary surface is assumed to have a void or vacuum
boundary condition. Any <strong>CHORD</strong>ed surfaces that are <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>
boundaries will use the default (void) boundary condition, and it cannot
be changed. This restriction may need to be considered when building the
geometry of the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>.</p>

<p>The biasing data block is used (in only multigroup mode) to define the
weight that is given to a neutron surviving Russian roulette. The
average weight of a neutron that survives Russian roulette, <em>wtavg</em>, is
defaulted to <em>dwtav</em> (<strong>WTA</strong>= in the parameter data [see <a class="reference internal" href="#id3"><span class="std std-ref">Title and parameter data</span></a>])
for all <em>BIAS IDs</em> and can be overridden by entering biasing
information.</p>
<p>The <em>biasing_information</em> is used to relate a <em>BIAS ID</em> to the desired
energy-dependent values of <em>wtavg</em>. This concept is similar to the way
the <em>MIXTURE ID, mat</em>, is related to the macroscopic cross section data.</p>
<p>The weighting functions used in KENO  are energy-dependent values of
<em>wtavg</em> that are applicable over a given thickness interval of a
material. For example, the weighting function for water is composed of
sets of energy-dependent values of <em>wtavg</em> for 11 intervals, each
interval being 3 cm thick. The first set of <em>wtavg’s</em> is for the 0–3 cm
interval of water, the second set of <em>wtavg’s</em> is for the 3–6 cm
interval of water, etc. The eleventh set of <em>wtavg’s</em> is for the 30–33
cm interval of water.</p>
<p>To input biasing information, a <em>BIAS ID</em> must be assigned to correspond
to a set of <em>wtavg</em>. Biasing data can specify a <em>MATERIAL ID</em> from the
existing KENO V.a weighting library or from the <em>AUXILIARY DATA</em> input.
The materials available from the KENO  weighting library are listed in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-20"><span class="std std-numref">Table 49</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>biasing_information</em> is entered in one of the following two forms.
The first set is said to input the <em>CORRELATION DATA</em>, while the second
form is said to input the <em>AUXILIARY DATA</em>.</p>
<p><strong>READ BIAS ID</strong>=<em>m ib ie</em> <strong>END BIAS</strong></p>

alone and a Monte Carlo cross section format library is not being used
in the multigroup mode, or KENO is being run stand alone in the
continuous energy mode. If the parameter <strong>LIB</strong>= (Sect. 8.1.2.3) is
entered, then mixing table data must be entered. A cross section mixing
table is entered using the following syntax:</p>
<p><strong>READ MIXT</strong> <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>p</em><sub>N</sub> <strong>END MIXT</strong></p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><em>p</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>p</em><sub>N</sub></dt><dd><p>are <em>N</em> parameters that might or might not be keyworded.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The possible parameters that can be used in a <strong>MIXT</strong> block are
described below.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>SCT =</strong> <em>nsct</em></dt><dd><p>is used to input the number of scattering angles and
only applies in multigroup mode. <em>nsct</em> is the number of discrete
scattering angles, default = 1. The number of scattering angles
specifies the number of discrete scattering angles to be used for the
cross sections. If SCT is not set (i.e., SCT= −1), then the number of
scattering angles is determined from the cross section library
specified. The number of scattering angles defaults to (ncoef+1)/2,
where ncoef is the largest Legendre polynomial order used in the
problem. It needs to be entered only once for a problem. If more than
one value is entered, the last one is used for the problem. For
assistance in determining the number of discrete scattering angles for
the cross sections, see <a class="reference internal" href="#id31"><span class="std std-ref">Number of scattering angles</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>EPS =</strong> <em>pbxs</em></dt><dd><p>is used to enter the cross section message cutoff
value, and it only applies in multigroup mode. <em>pbxs</em> is the value of
the P<sub>0</sub> cross section for each transfer, above which generated
warning messages will be printed, default = 3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. The
primary purpose of entering this cutoff value is to suppress printing
these messages when they are generated during cross section processing.
For assistance in determining a value for EPS, see <a class="reference internal" href="#id32"><span class="std std-ref">Cross section message cutoff</span></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MIX =</strong> <em>mix</em></dt><dd><p>is used to input the identification number of the
mixture being described. <em>mix</em> defines the mixture being described.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>NCM</strong> = <em>ncmx</em></dt><dd><p>is used to input the nuclide mixture IDs to be used for
this mixture. <em>ncmx</em> defines the nuclide mixture ID. When
<strong>MIX</strong>=<em>mix</em> is read, <em>ncmx</em> is defaulted to <em>mix</em> also. Then, as
long as all the nuclides that need to be mixed into <em>mix</em> already have
<em>mix</em> specified as their nuclide mixture (frequently the case when using
SCALE), the user does not need to specify <strong>NCM</strong>. The most usual case
where <strong>NCM</strong> must be specified is when the mixtures were specified as a
different mixture number when they were created in SCALE as compared to
the mixture number used for them in KENO. Cell homogenized mixtures also
need <strong>NCM</strong> specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TMP</strong>|<strong>TEM</strong> = <em>temperature</em></dt><dd><p>is used to input the desired
temperature of the CE cross section data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>nucl</em></dt><dd><p>is the nuclide ID number from the AMPX working format cross
section library.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>XS</strong>=<em>fname</em></dt><dd><p>is used to input the optional continuous energy cross
section filename to override the default cross sections. <em>fname</em> is the
name of the file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>dens</em></dt><dd><p>is the number density (atoms/b-cm) associated with nuclide ID
number <em>nucl</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The sequence “<em>nucl</em> <strong>NCM</strong>=<em>ncmx</em> [<strong>XS</strong>=<em>fname</em>] <em>dens</em>”
may be repeated until the mixture defined by <strong>MIX</strong>=<em>mix</em> has been
completely described.</p>
<p>The sequence “<strong>MIX =</strong> <em>mix</em> <strong>NCM</strong> = <em>ncmx</em> <strong>TMP</strong>|<strong>TEM</strong> =
<em>temperature nucl</em> <strong>NCM</strong>=<em>ncmx</em> [<strong>XS</strong>=<em>fname</em>] <em>dens</em>” may
be repeated until all the mixtures have been described.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If a given nuclide ID is entered more than once in the same
mixture, then the number densities for that nuclide are summed.</p>
<p>If a mixture number is used as a nuclide ID, then it is treated as a
nuclide and the number density associated with it is used as a
density modifier. (If the density is entered as 1, then the mixture
is mixed in at full density. If it is entered as 0.5, the mixture is
mixed in at one half of its full density.) A Monte Carlo formatted
cross section library is generated on the unit defined by the
parameter <strong>XSC=</strong>. If this data set is saved, subsequent cases can
utilize these mixtures without remixing.</p>
<p>The entry <strong>XS</strong>=<em>fname</em> is optional. If a nuclide is entered
more than once in a mixture and this entry is specified, then they
must be the same (i.e., cannot use more than one continuous energy
cross section sets for a nuclide in a given mixture). Different
mixtures may have the same nuclide with different continuous energy
cross section sets.</p>

<div class="section" id="plot-data">
<span id="id16"></span><h3>Plot data<a class="headerlink" href="#plot-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plots of slices specified through the geometry can be generated and
displayed (1) as character plots using alphanumeric characters to
represent mixture numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers or (2) as
color plots which generate a PNG file using colors to represent mixture
numbers, unit numbers or bias ID numbers. Color plots require an
independent program to display the PNG file to a PC or workstation
monitor or to convert the file to be displayed using a plotting device.
The keyword <strong>SCR=</strong> is used to control the plot display method.
<strong>SCR</strong>=YES, the default value, uses the color plot display method.
<strong>SCR</strong>=NO uses the character plot display method. The value of
<strong>SCR</strong> determines the plot display method for all the plots specified
in a problem. If <strong>SCR</strong>= is entered more than once, the last entry
determines the plot display method. In other words, all plots generated
by a problem will be either character plots or color plots.</p>
<p>The plot data can include the data for any or all types of plots. A plot
by mixture number is the default. The kind of plot is defined by the
parameter <strong>PIC=</strong>. Character plots are printed after the volumes are
printed and before the final preparations for tracking are completed.
Plot data are not required for a problem, but theyb can be used to
verify the problem description. The actual plotting of the picture can
be suppressed by entering <strong>PLT= NO</strong> in the parameter data or plot
data. This allows plot data to be kept in the problem input for
reference purposes without actually plotting the picture(s). Entering a
value for <strong>PLT</strong> in the plot data will override any value entered in
the parameter data. However, if a problem is restarted, the value of
<strong>PLT</strong> from the parameter data is used. The upper left and lower right
coordinates of the plot must be specified relative to the origin of the
problem. See <span class="xref std std-ref">8-1-3-9</span> for a discussion of plot origins and plot
data.</p>
<p>Enter the plot data using the following syntax:</p>
<p><strong>READ PLOT</strong> <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>p</em><sub>N</sub> <strong>END PLOT</strong></p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><em>p</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>p</em><sub>N</sub></dt><dd><p>are <em>N</em> parameters entered using keywords followed by the
appropriate data. The plot title and the plot character string must be
contained within delimiters. Enter as many picture parameters as
necessary to describe the plot. Multiple sets of plot data can be
entered. The parameter input for each plot is terminated by a labeled or
unlabeled <strong>END</strong>. The labeled <strong>END</strong> cannot use the word <strong>PLOT</strong> as
the first four characters of the label. For example, <strong>END PLT1</strong> is a
valid label, but <strong>END PLOT1</strong> is not. If an unlabeled <strong>END</strong> is used,
it cannot start in column 1.</p>

It may be entered only if plots are to be made utilizing the color
plot display method (<strong>SCR</strong>=YES). After entering the keyword
<strong>CLR=</strong>, 4 numbers are entered <em>N</em> times. The first number, <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>,
represents a media (mixture) number, unit number, or bias ID. The
next three numbers, whose values can range from 0 through 255, define
the <em>red, green, and blue</em> components of the color that will
represent this <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> in the plot. The sequence of 4 numbers is
repeated until the colors associated with all of the media (mixture)
numbers, unit numbers, or bias IDs used in the problem have been
defined. The smallest number that can be entered for <em>n</em><sub>i</sub> is −1,
representing undefined regions in the plot. An <em>ni</em> of 0 represents
void regions; <em>n</em><sub>i</sub> of 1 represents the smallest media, unit, or
bias ID used in the problem; <em>n</em><sub>i</sub> of 2 represents the next larger
media, unit, or bias ID used in the problem, etc. The color plot
definition data are terminated by entering the keywords <strong>END
COLOR</strong>. A total of 256 default colors are provided in <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-22"><span class="std std-numref">Table 51</span></a>
Two of those colors represent undefined regions, <em>n</em><sub>i</sub>=-1*, as
black and void regions, and <em>n</em><sub>i</sub>=0 as gray. The remaining 254
colors represent the default values for mixtures, bias IDs, or unit
numbers used in the problem. If <strong>num</strong> is entered as <strong>−1</strong>, the
next three numbers define the color that will be used to represent
undefined regions of the plot. The default color for undefined
regions is black, represented as 0 0 0. If <em>n</em><sub>i</sub> is entered as 0,
the next three numbers define the color that will represent void
regions in the plot. The default color for void is gray, represented
as 200 200 200. For example, assume a color plot is to be made for a
problem that uses void regions and mixture numbers 1, 3, and 5. By
default, the undefined regions (Index −1) will be black; void regions
(Index 0) will be gray; the first mixture, mixture 1 (Index 1), will
be medium blue; the next larger mixture, mixture 3 (Index 2), will be
turquoise2; and the last mixture, mixture 5 (Index 3), will be
green2. If these values are acceptable, data do not need to be
entered for <strong>CLR</strong>=. If the user decides to define void to be
white (255 255 255), mixture 1 to be red (255 0 0), mixture 3 to be
bright blue (0 0 255), and mixture 5 to be green (0 255 0), then the
following data could be entered:</p>
<p><strong>CLR</strong>=0 255 255 255 1 255 0 0 2 0 0 255 3 0 255 0 <strong>END COLOR</strong></p>
<p>In this example, the first number (0) defines the void, and the next
three numbers are the <em>red, green, and blue</em> components that combine
as the color white. The fifth number (1) represents the smallest
mixture number (mixture 1), and the next three numbers are the <em>red,
green, and blue</em> components of red. The ninth number (2) represents
the next larger mixture number (mixture 3), and the next three
numbers are the <em>red, green, and blue</em> components of bright blue. The
thirteenth number (3) represents the next larger mixture number
(mixture 5), and the next three numbers are the red, green, and blue
components of green. The <strong>END COLOR</strong> terminates the color
definition data. Because color data were not entered for <em>ni</em> of
−1, undefined regions will be represented by the color black, the

<dl>
<dt><strong>READVOL</strong>=<em>vol</em></dt><dd><p>used to input the file name (up to 256 characters)
of the file from which user-specified volumes are read. This is an
optional parameter and only works for KENO-VI. The data are read in
sections for each <strong>UNIT</strong> contained in the problem. First the keyword
“<strong>UNIT</strong>” is read, followed by the <strong>UNIT</strong> number. For that
<strong>UNIT</strong> the data for each region containing material in the order shown
in the input is read as follows: the keyword “<strong>MEDIA</strong>” is read,
followed by the mixture number, followed by the keyword “<strong>VOL</strong>=”,
followed by the total volume for that region. Regions containing
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <strong>HOLE</strong>s are skipped. An example of the data
contained in a volume file is given later in this section.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>TYPE</strong>=<em>vcalc</em></dt><dd><p>used to determine the type of volume calculation.
<em>vcalc</em> can have the values:</p>

<strong>YFACE</strong>, or <strong>ZFACE</strong>. KENO-VI will integrate over the face with the
smallest area by default. This allows specifying a different face. Used
only for <strong>TYPE</strong>=TRACE (KENO-VI).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The volume parameters include specifying the type of calculation to
determine the volumes and additional parameters needed for the selected
type. In KENO-VI the default type is NONE (i.e., no volume calculation
will be performed), and the volumes for regions not containing
<strong>HOLE</strong>s or <strong>ARRAY</strong>s will be set to -1.0. No other data are
needed for this type.</p>
<p>In KENO-VI the volume data may be entered for any or all regions within
the geometry data by placing the keyword <strong>VOL</strong>= followed by the
total volume of that region in the problem at the end of the <strong>MEDIA</strong>
card. See <a class="reference internal" href="#id4"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry data</span></a> (Geometry Data) for more details.</p>
<p>For KENO-VI, in the same problem, volumes may be entered using a
combination of three methods: (1) in the geometry data using <strong>VOL</strong>=,
(2) read from a volume file, and (3) calculated. The calculated volumes
(method 3) are obtained for both the regions, and the meshes are defined
by a grid (such as in TSUNAMI runs). As for KENO V.a, the mesh volumes
must always be calculated (i.e., there is no method to input the mesh
volumes). If volumes are entered or calculated using more than one
method, the following hierarchy is used to determine which volume is
used for the regions.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Volumes entered as part of a <strong>MEDIA</strong> card using <strong>VOL</strong>= are
always used.</p></li>
<li><p>Volumes read from the volume file are used if that volume for the
region was not specified using VOL= following a <strong>MEDIA</strong> card.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculated volumes are used if they are not specified using
<strong>VOL</strong>= and if there is no volume file or data for that region on
the volume file.</p></li>
<li><p>Volumes that have not been set or calculated will be set to –1.0.
This may result in negative fluxes and fission densities for these
regions.</p></li>
<li><p>Volumes are only calculated for regions containing material. Regions
containing <strong>ARRAY</strong>s or <strong>HOLE</strong>s have no volume. Those volumes
are associated with the <strong>UNIT</strong> contained in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> or
<strong>HOLE</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In KENO V.a, the region volumes are always calculated by the code
without the user’s intervention. This is possible because KENO V.a has
no region intersections, so calculation of the volumes is always
possible using analytical methods. The use of the (RANDOM) calculated
volumes using the <strong>VOLUME</strong> block is then only justified when the user
needs to calculate the volumes defined by a grid, such as for TSUNAMI
calculations.</p>
<p>When volumes are calculated using either RANDOM or TRACE, then a file
containing volumes and named _volxxxx (where xxxx is an 18-digit number
with the leftmost unused digits padded with zeros) is created in the
temporary directory. The program searches the temporary directory for a
file name beginning with _vol. If it is not found, the volume file that
is created is named _vol000000000000000000. If a file exists, then a
new file will be created where the file number is the largest number
associated with a previous volume file incremented by 1. The file is
automatically copied to the user directory with the input file base name
prepended to it, such as inputfile.volxxxx.volumes.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the <strong>VOLUME</strong> data block associated with a case
in which volumes are being calculated using ray tracing. The number of
rays used is set to one million, and if the outer unit volume is not a
cuboid, then a cuboid will be placed around the global region prior to
calculating volumes.</p>

<div class="section" id="reaction-data">
<span id="id19"></span><h3>Reaction data<a class="headerlink" href="#reaction-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reaction data block is used to specify the type of tally (e.g.,
reaction rates, flux, and few group reaction cross sections) and the
reaction/nuclide pairs in any mixture used in the problem for reaction
tally calculations. This block is operational only with the continuous
energy mode, and it provides the specifications for reaction rate,
neutron flux, and reaction cross section tallies. See <span class="xref std std-ref">8-1-6-6</span> for
more details. For multigroup KENO calculations, use KMART5 or KMART6,
which are described in the KMART section of the SCALE manual.</p>
<p>A reaction data block consists of REACTION FILTERS, TALLY TYPE, ENERGY
GROUP BOUNDARIES, and OUTPUT EDITS. These data types can be entered in
any order. A combination of parameters for describing the REACTION
FILTERS and TALLY TYPE must be entered for any reaction or cross section
tally calculation. ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES and OUTPUT EDITS data are
optional. Tally calculations can be performed for multiple reactions
specified by the REACTION FILTERS. Only one energy grid, either
specified with the data in ENERGY GROUP BOUNDARIES or from the READ
ENERGY block or from the code defaults, is used for all reaction tally
calculations. To provide data for the continuous energy depletion
calculations, another energy grid can be specified and used for tallying
only the mixture flux.</p>
<p>Enter REACTION DATA in the form:</p>
<dl class="simple">

<strong>MTLIST</strong>). Each filter is defined using a combination of the following
keywords:</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>MIX</strong>=<em>mixnum</em></dt><dd><p>Mixture number, no default value. Specified mixture
number must exist in the mixing table and be used in the problem for a

</dd>
<dt><strong>NUC</strong>=<em>nucid</em></dt><dd><p>Nuclide identifier, no default value. Specified
nuclide must be a constituent of the mixtures used in this filter
definition (specified with MIX or MIXLIST). A wildcard “*” can be used
to define a filter applicable for all nuclides in each mixture in this

the Standard Composition Library section of the SCALE manual (see <span class="xref std std-ref">7-2</span>).</p>

can be used to define a filter with all reaction MTs. Valid SCALE
library MT values are listed in the SCALE Cross Section Libraries
section of the SCALE manual (see Appendix A of <span class="xref std std-ref">11-1</span>).</p>

Within each filter, use either <strong>MT</strong> or <strong>MTLIST</strong>, but not both.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A reaction filter consists of either single or multiple mixture, nuclide
and reaction definitions. A valid reaction filter starts with mixture
specification, followed by nuclide specification, and ends with reaction
specification. Mixture(s) must be specified with either <strong>MIX</strong> or
<strong>MIXLIST</strong> keywords. Nuclide(s) in these mixtures must be entered with
either <strong>NUC</strong> or <strong>NUCLIST</strong>, and reactions for each nuclide must be
specified with either <strong>MT</strong> or <strong>MTLIST</strong>.</p>
<p>Mixture, nuclide, and reaction number are required for mixture average
fluxes, even though the nuclide and reaction numbers are not used for
the neutron flux tallies.</p>
<p>Multiple reaction filter definitions are allowed. KENO processes all the
definitions and creates a reaction map based on them. The following
examples demonstrate the reaction filter specifications for different
problems. In these examples, reaction filters are specified based on the
following composition data used in the problem:</p>

<span id="id23"></span><h3>Data entry<a class="headerlink" href="#data-entry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The KENO data is entered in blocks that begin and end with keywords as
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#id2"><span class="std std-ref">Keno input outline</span></a>. Only one set of parameter data can be
entered for a problem. However, for other data blocks, it is possible to
enter more than one block of the same kind of data. When this is done,
only the last block of that kind of data is retained for use by the
problem, except for the GRID block for which all blocks are retained.</p>
<p>Within data blocks, a number, x, can be repeated n times by specifying
nRx, n*x, or n$x.</p>
<p>Numbers in engineering notation may be specified with or without an “E”
between the base and the exponent. For example; 0.0011 may be specified
as 1.1e-3 or as 1.1-3.</p>

<span id="id24"></span><h4>Multiple and scattered entries in the mixing table<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-and-scattered-entries-in-the-mixing-table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the following examples, assume 1001 is the nuclide ID for hydrogen,
8016 is the nuclide ID for oxygen, 92235 is the nuclide ID for
<sup>235</sup>U, and 92238 is the nuclide ID for <sup>238</sup>U. If a given
nuclide ID is used more than once in the same mixture, the result is the
summing of all the number densities associated with that nuclide. For
example:</p>
<p><strong>MIX</strong>=1 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 92235 1.1e-3 8016
1.8e-2</p>
<p>would be the same as entering:</p>
<p><strong>MIX</strong>=1 92235 4.41e-2 92238 2.6e-3 1001 3.7e-2 8016 1.8e-2</p>
<p>A belated entry for a mixture can be made as follows:</p>
<p><strong>MIX</strong>=1 1001 6.6e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3 MIX=1 8016
3.3e-2</p>
<p>This is the same as entering:</p>
<p><strong>MIX</strong>=1 1001 6.6e-2 8016 3.3e-2 MIX=2 92235 4.3e-2 92238 2.6e-3</p>

<p>Individual geometry regions cannot be replaced by adding an additional
description. However, entire unit descriptions can be replaced by adding
a new description having the same unit number. The last description
entered for a unit is used in the calculation. For example, the
following geometry descriptions are equivalent in KENO V.a and KENO-VI,
respectively:</p>

<span id="id27"></span><h3>Parameter input<a class="headerlink" href="#parameter-input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the parameter data block is entered for a problem, the same keyword
may be entered several times. The last value that is entered is used in
the problem. Data may be entered as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-scale notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">READ</span> <span class="err">PARAM</span>  <span class="err">FLX=YES</span> <span class="err">NPG=</span><span class="m">1000</span> <span class="err">TME=</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="m">5</span> <span class="err">TME=</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="m">0</span>

<span class="err">NPG=</span><span class="m">500</span>
<span class="err">END</span> <span class="err">PARA</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will result in the problem having <strong>FLX=NO</strong>, <strong>TME=10.0</strong>, and
<strong>NPG=500</strong>. It may be more convenient for the user to insert a new
value than to change the existing data.</p>
<p>Certain parameter default values should not be overridden unless the
user has a very good reason to do so. These parameters are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>1. <strong>X1D=</strong> which defines the number of extra 1-D cross sections. The
use of extra 1‑D cross sections—other than the use of the fission
cross section for calculating the average number of neutrons per
fission—requires programming changes to the code;</p>
<p>2. <strong>NFB=</strong> which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
in the fission bank (the fission bank is where the information
related to a fission is stored);</p>
<p>3. <strong>XFB=</strong> which defines the number of extra positions in the
fission bank;</p>
<p>4. <strong>NBK=</strong> which defines the number of neutrons that can be entered
in the neutron bank (the neutron bank contains information about each
history);</p>
<p>5. <strong>XNB=</strong> which defines the number of extra positions in the
neutron bank;</p>
<p>6. <strong>WTH=</strong> which defines the factor that determines when splitting
occurs;</p>
<p>7. <strong>WTA=</strong> which defines the default average weight given to a
neutron that survives Russian roulette;</p>
<p>8. <strong>WTL=</strong> which defines the factor that determines when Russian
roulette is played; and</p>
<p>9. <strong>LNG=</strong> which sets the maximum words of storage available to the
program.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It is recommended that <strong>BUG=</strong>, the flag for printing debug
information, <strong>never</strong> be set to YES. The user would have to look at the
FORTRAN coding to determine what information is printed. <strong>BUG</strong>=YES
prints massive amounts of sparsely labeled information. The user should
only rarely consider using <strong>TRK</strong>=YES. This generates thousands of
lines of well-labeled output that provides information about each
history at key locations during the tracking procedure. All other
parameters can be changed at will to provide features the user wishes to
activate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-sections">
<span id="id28"></span><h3>Cross sections<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-sections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In multi-energy group mode, KENO always uses cross sections from a mixed
cross section data file. The format of this file is the Monte Carlo
processed cross section file. A mixed cross section file can be created
by previous KENO run, or  by using an AMPX working format library and
entering mixing table data in KENO.</p>
<div class="section" id="use-a-mixed-cross-section-monte-carlo-format-library">
<span id="id29"></span><h4>Use a mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library<a class="headerlink" href="#use-a-mixed-cross-section-monte-carlo-format-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A mixed cross section Monte Carlo format library (premixed cross section
data file) from a previous KENO case may be used. This file is specified
using the parameter <strong>XSC</strong>=. If a mixing table data block is entered,
the premixed cross section data file will be rewritten. Therefore, a
mixing table should not be entered if a premixed cross section data file
is used. The user should verify that the mixtures created by a previous
KENO case are consistent with those used in the geometry data of the
problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-an-ampx-working-format-library">
<span id="id30"></span><h4>Use an AMPX working format library<a class="headerlink" href="#use-an-ampx-working-format-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When an AMPX working format library is used, it must be specified using
the parameter <strong>LIB</strong>=, and mixing table data must always be entered.
IDs used in the mixing table must match the IDs on the AMPX working
format library. The user must provide a file with the correct cross
sections with a name that matches the pattern ftNNf001, with NN being
the number of the logical unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="number-of-scattering-angles">
<span id="id31"></span><h4>Number of scattering angles<a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-scattering-angles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The number of scattering angles is defaulted to 1 (defaulted to 2 when
KENO-VI is run as part of the CSAS6 sequence). This stand alone default
is not adequate for many applications. The user should specify the
scattering angle to be consistent with the cross sections being used.
The number of scattering angles is entered in the cross section mixing
table by using the keyword <strong>SCT</strong>=. See <a class="reference internal" href="#id15"><span class="std std-ref">Mixing table data</span></a>.</p>
<p>The order of the last Legendre coefficient to be preserved in the
scattering distribution is equal to (2 × SCT − 1). <strong>SCT</strong>=1 could be
used with a P<sub>1</sub> cross section set such as the 16-group
Hansen-Roach cross section library, and <strong>SCT</strong>=2, for a P<sub>3</sub>
cross section set such as the SCALE 27-group cross section library.
ENDF/B-V cross section libraries such as the 44-group or 238-group
libraries contain many nuclides having P<sub>5</sub> cross section sets.
Isotropic scattering is achieved by entering <strong>SCT</strong>=0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cross-section-message-cutoff">
<span id="id32"></span><h4>Cross section message cutoff<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-section-message-cutoff" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The cross section message cutoff value, <em>pbxs</em>, is defaulted to
3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. Warning messages generated when errors are
encountered in the P<sub>L</sub> expansion of the group-to-group transfers
will be suppressed if the P<sub>0</sub> cross section for that particular
energy transfer is less than <em>pbxs</em>. The value of <em>pbxs</em> is specified in
the cross section mixing table by using the keyword <strong>EPS</strong>=. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#id15"><span class="std std-ref">Mixing table data</span></a>.</p>
<p>The default value of <em>pbxs</em> is sufficient to assure that warning
messages will not be printed for most of the SCALE P<sub>1</sub> and
P<sub>3</sub> cross section libraries. However, the v7.0-238n library may
print a few errors if P<sub>5</sub> cross sections are specified.</p>
<p>The error messages below were printed for a problem using the 238-group
cross section library and <em>pbxs</em> = 3.0 × 10<sup>–5</sup>. If the default
value of <em>pbxs</em> allows too many warning messages to be printed, a value
can be determined which does not print the error messages from the
printed messages by choosing a number larger than the P<sub>0</sub>
component on the first line, as shown below.</p>
<p>THE LEGENDRE EXPANSION OF THE CROSS SECTION (P<sub>0</sub>-P<sub>N</sub>) IS
P<sub>0</sub> P<sub>1</sub> P<sub>2</sub> … P<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>THE MOMENTS CORRESPONDING TO THIS DISTRIBUTION ARE
M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> … M<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>THE MOMENTS CORRESPONDING TO THE GENERATED DISTRIBUTION ARE
M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> … M<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>THE LEGENDRE EXPANSION CORRESPONDING TO THESE MOMENTS IS
P<sub>0</sub> P<sub>1</sub> P<sub>2</sub> … P<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>___ MOMENTS WERE ACCEPTED</p>
<p>For the following messages, <strong>EPS</strong>=6.9e−5 would cause all three
messages to be suppressed. A value less than 5.615159e−5 and greater
than 4.767635e−5 would suppress the second message, and a value less
than 6.855362e−5 and greater than 5.615159e−5 would suppress the first
two messages.</p>

<p>Here the intent is for mixture 2 to be full-density water, mixture 1 to
be half-density water, and mixture 3 to be 3/8 (0.75 × 0.5) density
water. Instead, the result for mixture 3 is a void, mixture 1 is
half-density water, and mixture 2 is full-density water. This is because
the nuclide mixing loop is done first, thus defining mixture 2. The
mixture mixing loop is done next. Mixture 3 is defined to be mixture 1
multiplied by 0.75, but since mixture 1 has not been defined yet, 0.75
of zero is zero. Mixture 1 is then defined to be mixture 2 multiplied by
0.5. If the definition of mixture 1 preceded the definition of
mixture 3, as in item (2) under examples of correct usage, it would work

because 1001 is the nuclide ID number for hydrogen. When a mixture
number is identical to a nuclide ID and is used in mixing, that number
is assumed to be a nuclide ID rather than a mixture number. The intent

<p>In general, KENO geometry descriptions consist of (1) geometry data
(<a class="reference internal" href="#id4"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry data</span></a>) defining the geometrical shapes present in the problem,
and (2) array data (<a class="reference internal" href="#id5"><span class="std std-ref">ARRAY Data</span></a>) defining the placement of the units
that were defined in the geometry data. The geometry data block is
prefaced by <strong>READ GEOM</strong>, and the array data block is prefaced by
<strong>READ ARRAY</strong>.</p>
<p>When a 3-D geometrical configuration is described as KENO geometry data,
it may be necessary to describe portions of the configuration
individually. These individual partial descriptions of the configuration
are called <strong>UNIT</strong>s. KENO geometry modeling is subject to the
following restrictions:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Units are composed of regions. These regions are created using</dt><dd><p>geometric bodies and surfaces (<strong>shape</strong>s) that are previously
defined.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In KENO-VI the geometric bodies and surfaces may intersect.
Regions are defined relative to the geometric bodies and surfaces
in a <strong>UNIT</strong>. <strong>HOLE</strong>s provide a means of creating complex
geometries in a <strong>UNIT</strong> and then inserting the <strong>UNIT</strong> into
existing <strong>UNIT</strong>s. For complex geometries the use of
<strong>HOLE</strong>s may decrease the CPU time required for the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>In KENO V.a, each geometry region in a <strong>UNIT</strong> must completely
enclose all geometry regions which precede it. Boundaries of the
surfaces of the regions may be shared or tangent, but they must
not intersect. The use of <strong>HOLE</strong>s in KENO V.a provides an
exception to this complete enclosure rule. The use of <strong>HOLE</strong>s
in KENO V.a will increase the CPU time required for the problem.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>All geometrical surfaces must be describable in KENO V.a as spheres,</dt><dd><p>hemispheres, cylinders, hemicylinders, cubes, cuboids, or as a set
of quadratic equations in KENO-VI.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>When specifying an <strong>ARRAY</strong>, each <strong>UNIT</strong> used in a cuboidal</dt><dd><p><strong>ARRAY</strong> must have a <strong>CUBE</strong> or <strong>CUBOID</strong> as its outer region
(this is the only option in KENO V.a); a hexprism as the outer
boundary if it is a hexagonal, triangular, or shexagonal
<strong>ARRAY</strong>; a rhexprism as the outer boundary if it is a rhexagonal
<strong>ARRAY</strong>; and a dodecahedron as the outer boundary if it is a
dodecahedral <strong>ARRAY</strong>. In addition, the outer boundary of a

<li><dl class="simple">

<strong>BOUNDARY</strong> can be placed in a <strong>UNIT</strong> without intersecting each

regions within the <strong>UNIT</strong> in which they are placed. <strong>HOLE</strong>s
are described in more detail in <a class="reference internal" href="#id35"><span class="std std-ref">Use of holes in the geometry</span></a>, and nested
<strong>HOLE</strong>s are described in <a class="reference internal" href="#id36"><span class="std std-ref">Nesting holes</span></a>.</p>

<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s may be required to describe a complicated</dt><dd><p>system. In KENO V.a, only one <strong>ARRAY</strong> may be placed directly
into a <strong>UNIT</strong>. However, multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s may be placed in a
<strong>UNIT</strong> by placing the <strong>ARRAY</strong>s in other <strong>UNIT</strong>s and
placing those <strong>UNIT</strong>s in the original <strong>UNIT</strong> using
<strong>HOLE</strong>s. Multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s may be placed directly into a
<strong>UNIT</strong> in KENO-VI. These <strong>UNIT</strong>s may then be used to create
other <strong>ARRAY</strong>s, or they may be placed in other <strong>UNIT</strong>s
using <strong>HOLE</strong>s. <strong>UNIT</strong>s placed in <strong>ARRAY</strong>s or
<strong>HOLE</strong>s that are contained in other <strong>HOLE</strong>s or
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s are said to be nested. The nesting level of a
<strong>UNIT</strong> is the number of <strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <strong>HOLE</strong>s between the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> or <strong>HOLE</strong> in the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> or <strong>ARRAY</strong> and the
<strong>UNIT</strong>. Multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s are described in more detail in

<p>The KENO V.a geometry package allows any applicable <strong>shape</strong> to be
enclosed by any other applicable <strong>shape</strong>, subject only to the complete
enclosure restriction. The KENO-VI geometry package allows any <strong>shape</strong>
describable using quadratic equations to be enclosed or intersected by
any other allowable <strong>shape</strong>. The implication of this type of
description is that the entire volume between two adjacent geometrical
surfaces contains only one mixture, <strong>HOLE</strong>, or <strong>ARRAY</strong>. A void is
specified by a mixture ID of zero. If <strong>HOLE</strong>s are present in the
volume between two surfaces, the volume of that region is reduced by the
<strong>HOLE</strong>’s volume(s).</p>
<p>In KENO V.a geometry, if the problem requires several <strong>UNIT</strong>s to
describe its geometrical characteristics, each <strong>UNIT</strong> that is used in
an <strong>ARRAY</strong> must have a rectangular parallelepiped as its outer
surface. This restriction is relaxed in KENO-VI, where the outer surface
may be a rectangular parallelepiped, a hexagonal prism, a 90º rotated
hexagonal prism, or a dodecahedron, but all units placed in an array
must use the same shape as their outer <strong>BOUNDARY</strong>. In order to
describe the composite overall geometrical characteristics of the
problem, these <strong>UNIT</strong>s may be arranged in a rectangular <strong>ARRAY</strong>
for KENO V.a geometry, or in either a rectangular, hexagonal,
shexagaonal, rhexagonal, or dodecahedral <strong>ARRAY</strong> for KENO-VI geometry.
This is done by specifying the number of units in the X, Y, and
Z directions. If more than one <strong>UNIT</strong> is involved, data must be
entered to define the number assigned to the <strong>ARRAY</strong> and the placement
of the individual <strong>UNIT</strong>s in the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The <strong>ARRAY</strong> number,
the number of <strong>UNIT</strong>s in the X, Y, and Z directions, and the
placement data are called <em>array data</em> (<a class="reference internal" href="#id5"><span class="std std-ref">ARRAY Data</span></a>).</p>
<p>In the KENO V.a geometry description, the surrounding regions of any
<strong>shape</strong> may be placed around an <strong>ARRAY</strong>, and they may consist of any
number of regions in any order subject to the complete enclosure
restriction. <strong>ARRAY</strong>s are positioned relative to the <strong>UNIT ORIGIN</strong>
by specifying the location of the most negative point in the array, i.e.
the most negative X, most negative Y, and most negative Z corner of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong>. In KENO-VI geometry, an <strong>ARRAY</strong> may be placed in a region
of any shape if the region boundary is contained within the <strong>ARRAY</strong> or
shares the <strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary and does not cut across nested
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s or <strong>HOLE</strong>s. In this case, only the section of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> contained within the region is recognized by the problem.
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s are positioned relative to the <strong>UNIT</strong> <strong>ORIGIN</strong> by
placing the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> of a specified <strong>UNIT</strong> in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> at a
specified location in the <strong>UNIT</strong>.</p>
<p>To create a geometry mockup from a physical configuration, the user
should keep the restrictions mentioned earlier in mind. There may be
several ways of correctly describing the same physical configuration.
Careful analysis of the system can result in a simpler mockup and
shorter computer running time. A mockup with fewer geometry regions may
run faster than the same mockup with extraneous regions. The number of
<strong>UNIT</strong>s used can affect the running time, because a transformation
of coordinates must be made every time a history moves from one <strong>UNIT</strong>
into another. Thus, if the size of a <strong>UNIT</strong> is small relative to the
mean free path, a larger percentage of time is spent processing the
transformation of coordinates. Because all boundaries in a <strong>UNIT</strong> must
be checked for crossings, it may be more efficient to break up complex
<strong>UNIT</strong>s into several smaller, simpler <strong>UNIT</strong>s. The trade-off
involves the time required to process more boundary crossings vs the
time required to transform coordinate systems when <strong>UNIT</strong> boundaries
are crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Geometry dimensions:</strong> The use of FIDO syntax may help simplify the
description of the geometry. For example, a 20 × 20 × 2.5 cm rectangular
parallelepiped would have been described as <strong>CUBOID</strong> 1 1 10.0 −10.0
10.0 −10.0 1.25 −1.25 in KENO V.a and <strong>CUBOID</strong> 1 10.0 –10.0 10.0 –10.0
1.25 –1.25 in KENO-VI. By using the P option (see Table 8.1.17), the
same rectangular parallelepiped could be described as <strong>CUBOID</strong> 1 1
4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO V.a and or <strong>CUBOID</strong> 1 4P10.0 2P1.25 in KENO-VI,
where the last 6 entries describe the geometry. The P option simply
repeats the dimension following the P for the number of times stated
before the P, and it reverses the sign every time. Therefore, 6P8.0 is
equivalent to 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0 8.0 −8.0.</p>
<p><strong>Geometry comments:</strong> One comment can be entered for each <strong>UNIT</strong> in
the <em>geometry region data</em>. Similarly, one comment can be entered for
each <strong>ARRAY</strong> in the <em>array definition data</em>. A comment can be entered
using the keyword <strong>COM</strong>=. This is followed by a comment with a
maximum length of 132 characters. The comment must be preceded and
terminated by a delimiter character. Acceptable delimiters include “ , ‘
, * , ^ , or !. One comment is allowed for each <strong>UNIT</strong> in the
<em>geometry region data</em>. If multiple comments are entered for a <strong>UNIT</strong>,
the last comment is used. The comment can be entered anywhere after the
<strong>UNIT</strong> number where a keyword is expected (<a class="reference internal" href="#id4"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry data</span></a>). See the
following example.</p>

<p>Some of the basics of KENO geometry are illustrated in the following examples:</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1. Assume a stack of six cylindrical disks each measuring 5 cm
in radius and 2 cm thick. The bottom disk is composed of material 1, and
the next disk is composed of material 2, etc., alternating throughout
the stack. A square plate of material 3 that is 20 cm on a side and
2.5 cm thick is centered on top of the stack. This configuration is
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-12"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id60">
<span id="fig8-1-12"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/fig121.png"><img alt="_images/fig121.png" src="_images/fig121.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 66 </span><span class="caption-text">Stack of disks with a square top.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id60" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>This problem can be described as a single <strong>UNIT</strong> problem, describing
the cylindrical portion first. In this instance, the origin has been
chosen at the center bottom of the bottom disk. The bottom disk is
defined by the first cylinder description, and the next disk is defined
by the difference between the first and second cylinder descriptions.
Since both disks have a radius of 5.0 and a −Z length of 0.0, the first
cylinder containing material 1 exists from Z = 0.0 to Z = 2.0, and the
second cylinder containing material 2 exists from Z = 2.0 to Z = 4.0.
When all the disks have been described, a void cuboid having the same X
and Y dimensions as the square plate and the same Z dimensions as the
stack of disks is defined. The square plate of material 3 is then
defined on top of the stack. Omission of the first cuboid description
would result in the stack of disks being encased in a solid cuboid of
material 3 instead of having a flat plate on top of the stack. The
geometry input is shown below.</p>

<p>An alternative description of the same example is given below. The
origin has been chosen at the center of the disk of material 1 nearest
the center of the stack. This disk of material 1 is defined by the first
cylinder description, and the disks of material 2 on either side of it
are defined by the second cylinder description. The top and bottom disks
of material 1 are defined by the third cylinder, and the top disk of
material 2 is defined by the last cylinder. The square plate is defined
by the two cuboids. This description is more efficient than the previous
one because there are fewer surfaces to check for crossings.</p>

<p>Example 1 can also be described as an <strong>ARRAY</strong>. Define three different
<strong>UNIT</strong> types. <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 will define a disk of material 1, <strong>UNIT</strong> 2
will define a disk of material 2, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 will define the square
plate of material 3. The origin of each <strong>UNIT</strong> is defined at the
center bottom of the disk or plate being described. As mentioned
earlier, only <strong>UNIT</strong>s with a <strong>CUBE</strong> or <strong>CUBOID</strong> as their outer
boundary can be placed in a cuboidal <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The geometry input for
this arrangement is shown below.</p>

<p>Be aware that each <strong>UNIT</strong> in a geometry description can have its
origin defined independent of the other <strong>UNIT</strong>s. It would be correct
to use <strong>UNIT</strong>s 1 and 3 from data descriptions 3, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 from
data description 4. The <em>array data</em> would remain the same as data
description 3, Example 1. The user should define the origin of each unit
to be as convenient as possible for the chosen description. Care should
be taken when assigning coordinates to the <strong>UNIT</strong> used to <strong>PLACE</strong>
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> in its surrounding region.</p>
<p>Another method of describing Example 1 as a bare array is to define
<strong>UNIT</strong> 1 to be a disk of material 1 topped by a disk of material 2.
The origin has been chosen at the center bottom of the disk of
material 1. <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 is the square plate of material 3 with the origin
at the center of the <strong>UNIT</strong>. The <strong>ARRAY</strong> consists of three
<strong>UNIT</strong> 1s, topped by a <strong>UNIT</strong> 2, as shown below.</p>

<p>Example 1 can be described as a reflected <strong>ARRAY</strong> by treating the
square plate as a reflector in the positive Z direction. One means of
describing this situation is to define <strong>UNIT</strong>s 1 and 2 as in data
description 3, Example 1. The origin of the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> is defined
to be at the center of the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The corresponding input geometry
is shown below.</p>

that there is no <strong>REPLICATE</strong> function in KENO-VI.</p>
<p>A simpler method of describing Example 1 as a reflected array is to
define only one unit as in data description 5, Example 1. The square
plate is treated as a reflector, as in data description 6, Example 1.
The input for this arrangement is given below.</p>

<p>In the above description, the origin is defined to be at the center of
the disk of material 1 nearest the center of the stack. This disk is
defined by the first cylinder description. The disks of material 2 above
and below it are defined by the second cylinder description. The disks
of material 1 above and below them are defined by the third cylinder
description. The top disk of material 2 is defined by the fourth
cylinder description. The void interior of the container is defined by
the fifth cylinder description. The container is defined by the last
cylinder description. The first cuboid description is used to define a
void whose X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate and whose
Z dimensions are the same as the container. The last cuboid description
defines the square plate. Omission of the first cuboid description would
result in the container being encased in a solid cuboid of material 3.
Thus, both cuboids are necessary to properly define the square plate.</p>
<p>Example 2 can be described as a reflected <strong>ARRAY</strong>. One of the
descriptions uses only one <strong>UNIT</strong> and is similar to data
description 7, Example 1. This description is shown below.</p>

<p>In the above data description, the first two cylinder descriptions
define a disk of material 1 with a disk of material 2 directly on top of
it. A tight fitting void cuboid is placed around them so they can be
stacked three high to achieve the stack of disks shown in Example 1,
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-12"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>. This array comprises the array portion of the geometry
region description. The origin of the array boundary, a tight fitting
cube or cuboid that encompasses the array, is defined by the <strong>ARRAY</strong>
description. Everything after the <strong>ARRAY</strong> record is considered part of
the reflector. The first cylinder after the <strong>ARRAY</strong> record defines the
void interior of the cylindrical container. The next cylinder defines
the walls of the container. The second-to-last cuboid defines a void
volume outside the container from its bottom to its top and having the
same X and Y dimensions as the square plate. The last cuboid defines the
square plate of material 3 that is sitting on top of the container.</p>
<p>Another method to describe Example 2 is as an array composed of units
that contain both the stack and container. This description requires a
minimum of four units to describe the problem. This configuration is
given below in data description 3, Example 2.</p>

<p>In the above description, <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 is the bottom of the cylindrical
container. The void <strong>CUBOID</strong> is only as tall as the bottom of the
container, and its X and Y dimensions are the same as the square plate
on top of the container. If all the <strong>UNIT</strong>s in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> use
these same dimensions in the X and Y directions, the requirement that
adjacent faces of units in contact with each other must be the same size
and shape is satisfied. This <strong>ARRAY</strong> is stacked in the Z direction, so
all <strong>UNIT</strong>s must have the same overall dimensions in the X direction
and in the Y direction. <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 will be used in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> three
times to create the stack of disks. It contains a disk of material 1
topped by a disk of material 2. The portion of the container that
contains the disks and the cuboid that defines the outer boundaries of
the unit are included in <strong>UNIT</strong> 2. <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 describes the empty top
portion of the container and the square plate on top of it. The
Z dimensions of <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 were determined by subtracting three times
the total Z dimension of <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 from the inside height of the
container [18.0 − (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. This can also be determined from the
overall height of the container by subtracting off the bottom thickness
of the container and three times the height of <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 [18.25 − 0.25
− (3 × 4.0) = 6.0]. The origin of <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is located at the center of
this distance. For the KENO-VI input, a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> is also
provided, <strong>UNIT</strong> 4, containing the <strong>ARRAY</strong> built with <strong>UNIT</strong>s 1,
2, 3.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 3. Refer to Example 1, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-12"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 66</span></a>, and imagine a <strong>HOLE</strong>
1.5 cm in diameter is drilled along the centerline of the stack through
the disks and the square plate. In KENO V.a this <strong>HOLE</strong> would
eliminate the possibility of describing the system as a single unit
because the <strong>HOLE</strong> in the center of the alternating materials of the
stack cannot be described in a manner that allows each successive
geometry region to encompass the regions interior to it. Therefore, it
must be described as an <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The square plate on the top of the
disks is defined as a <strong>UNIT</strong> in the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. In the geometry
description given below, the square plate is defined in <strong>UNIT</strong> 3.
KENO-VI can easily describe this configuration as a single <strong>UNIT</strong>.</p>

<p>In data description 1, Example 3 above, KENO V.a input, <strong>UNIT</strong> 1
describes a disk of material 1 with a <strong>HOLE</strong> through its centerline.
The first <strong>CYLINDER</strong> defines the <strong>HOLE</strong>, the second defines the rest
of the disk, and the <strong>CUBOID</strong> defines the size of the <strong>UNIT</strong> to be
consistent with the square plate so they can be stacked together in an
<strong>ARRAY</strong>. <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 describes a disk of material 2 in similar fashion.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 3 describes the square plate of material 3 with a <strong>HOLE</strong>
through its center. The <strong>CYLINDER</strong> defines the <strong>HOLE</strong> and the
<strong>CUBOID</strong> defines the square plate. These three <strong>UNIT</strong>s are stacked
in the Z direction to achieve the composite system. This is represented
by <strong>FILL</strong> 1 2 2Q2 3. The 2Q2 repeats the two entries preceding the 2Q2
twice. Alternatively, this can be achieved by entering <strong>FILL</strong> 1 2 1 2
1 2 3 <strong>END FILL</strong>. The same <strong>ARRAY</strong> can also be achieved using the
<strong>LOOP</strong> option. An example of the data for this option is:</p>
<p><strong>LOOP</strong> 1 6R1 1 5 2 2 6R1 2 6 2 3 6R1 7 7 1 <strong>END LOOP</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>UNIT</strong> 1 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, and Z = 1,3,5 positions of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> by entering 1 6R1 1 5 2. <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 is positioned at the X =
1, Y = 1 and Z = 2,4,6 positions in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> by entering 2 6R1 2 6
2. <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is placed at the X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 7 position of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> by entering 3 6R1 7 7 1. See Sect. 8.1.2.5 for additional
information regarding <strong>ARRAY</strong> specifications.</p>
<p>For the KENO-VI input, <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 contains the entire problem
description. The first <strong>CYLINDER</strong> describes the 1.5 cm diameter hole
through the stack. The next four <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s define the stack. The
sixth and seventh <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s describe the void and container. The
two <strong>CUBOID</strong>s describe the top plate and surrounding global region
of void. The <strong>MEDIA</strong> cards are used to place the materials in the
appropriate regions.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 4. Assume two large cylinders that are 2.5 cm in radius and 5 cm
long are connected by a smaller cylinder that is 0.5 cm in radius and
10 cm long, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-13"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 67</span></a>. All three cylinders are composed of
material 1. By starting the geometry description in the small cylinder,
this system can be described as a single unit.</p>

<p>The origin is at the center of the small cylinder, which is described by
the first cylinder description. The second cylinder description defines
a void cylinder surrounding the small cylinder. Its radius is the same
as the large cylinders, and its height (length) coincides with that of
the small cylinder. The last cylinder description defines the large
cylinders on either end of the small cylinder. In KENO V.a, because this
problem does not specify otherwise, the length of the <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s is
assumed to coincide with the Z axis. In KENO-VI, because the problem was
created using <strong>XCYLINDER</strong>s, the long axes of the <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s
coincide with the X axis.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 5. Assume two large cylinders with a center-to-center spacing of
15 cm, each having a radius of 2.5 cm and length of 5 cm, are connected
radially by a small cylinder having a radius of 1.5 cm, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-14"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 68</span></a>.</p>

<p>This system cannot be described rigorously in KENO V.a geometry because
the intersection of the cylinders cannot be described. However, it can
be approximated two ways, as shown in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">8-1-15</span></code>. The top approximation
is described in data description 1, Example 5. The bottom approximation
is described in data description 2, Example 5, and data description 3,
Example 5. These may be poor approximations for criticality safety
calculations.</p>

<p>The above geometry description uses <strong>ARRAY</strong>s of <strong>ARRAY</strong>s (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#id37"><span class="std std-ref">Multiple arrays</span></a>) to describe the bottom approximation of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-15"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 69</span></a>.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 1 defines a large <strong>CYLINDER</strong> that has a radius of 2.5 cm and
a height of 10 cm inside a close-fitting <strong>CUBOID</strong>. This is used in
both large <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s as the portion of the large <strong>CYLINDER</strong> that
exists above and below the region where the small <strong>CYLINDER</strong> joins it.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 5 is the spacing between the tops of the two large
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>s and the spacing between the bottoms of the two large
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>s. <strong>ARRAY</strong> 1 thus defines the bottom of the system:
two short <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s (<strong>UNIT</strong> 1s) separated by 10 cm (<strong>UNIT</strong> 5
is the separation). <strong>UNIT</strong> 6 contains <strong>ARRAY</strong> 1.</p>
<p><strong>UNIT</strong> 2 is the left hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is the right hemicylinder that adjoins the
horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong>. <strong>UNIT</strong> 4 defines the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong>.
<strong>ARRAY</strong> 2 contains <strong>UNIT</strong>s 2, 4, and 3 from left to right. This
defines the central portion of the system where the horizontal
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> adjoins the two hemicylinders. These hemicylinders are
larger than half <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s. <strong>UNIT</strong> 7 contains <strong>ARRAY</strong> 2. The
entire system is achieved by stacking a <strong>UNIT</strong> 6 above and below the
<strong>UNIT</strong> 7 as defined in <strong>ARRAY</strong> 3, the <strong>GLOBAL ARRAY</strong>.</p>

<p>The above geometry description uses <strong>HOLE</strong>s (see <a class="reference internal" href="#id35"><span class="std std-ref">Use of holes in the geometry</span></a>) to
describe the bottom approximation of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-15"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 69</span></a>. <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 defines a
large <strong>CYLINDER</strong> with a radius of 2.5 cm and a height of 1.0 cm.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 2 defines the same <strong>CYLINDER</strong> within a <strong>CUBOID</strong> that
extends from X = −2.5 to X = 17.5, from Y = −2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0
to Z = 1.0. The origin of the <strong>CYLINDER</strong> is at (0.0,0.0,0.0). Thus
<strong>UNIT</strong> 2 describes the top and bottom of the <strong>CYLINDER</strong> on the left.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 1 is positioned within this <strong>CUBOID</strong> as a <strong>HOLE</strong> with its
origin at (15.0,0.0,0.0) to describe the top and bottom of the
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> on the right. <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is the left hemicylinder that
adjoins the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong>, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 4 is the right
hemicylinder that adjoins the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong>. <strong>UNIT</strong> 5
defines the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong> with its origin at the center within
a <strong>CUBOID</strong> that extends from X = −10.0 to X = +10.0, Y = −2.5 to Y =
2.5, and Z = −1.5 to Z = 1.5. <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is positioned to the left of
the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong>, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 4 is positioned to the right
of the horizontal <strong>CYLINDER</strong> by using <strong>HOLE</strong>s. The entire system
is achieved by stacking a <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 above and below <strong>UNIT</strong> 5 as shown
in the <strong>ARRAY</strong> data.</p>
<p>This same geometry description can be used with <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 redefined,
having its origin defined so that it extends from X = −10 to X = 10, Y =
−2.5 to Y = 2.5, and Z = 0.0 to Z = 1. In this instance, the geometry
data would be identical except for <strong>UNIT</strong> 2. This alternative

<p>The first and second <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s define the two large
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>s, and the third <strong>CYLINDER</strong> describes the small
connecting <strong>CYLINDER</strong>. The two large <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s are oriented
along the Z axis. The second large cylinder is translated so its origin
is at position (0.0, 15.0, 0.0). The small <strong>CYLINDER</strong> is oriented
along the Y axis. Region 1 consists of the material in the first large
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>. Region 2 consists of the material in the second large
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>. Region 3 consists of the material in the small
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> but not in either of the large <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s. Region 4 is
the <strong>BOUNDARY</strong> region.</p>

<p>This problem is very similar to Example 4. It can be described as a
single <strong>UNIT</strong> in KENO-VI, but not in KENO V.a where it must be
described as an array. In KENO V.a, <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 defines the large
cylinder, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 defines the small cylinder. The origin of each
<strong>UNIT</strong> is at its center. The composite system consists of two
<strong>UNIT</strong> 2s and one <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 as shown below. In KENO-VI,
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> 1 defines the long thin cylinder, and <strong>CYLINDER</strong> 2
defines the short thick cylinder. The origin of each cylinder is at its
center. In both KENO V.a and KENO-VI, the centerline of the cylinders
lies along the Z axis.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 9. Assume an 11 × 5 × 3 square-pitched array of spheres of
material 1 with a 3.75 cm radius and 10 cm center-to-center spacing in
the X, Y, and Z directions. This array is reflected by 30 cm of
material 2 (water) on all faces, and weighted tracking (biasing) is to
be used in the water reflector. The array spacing defines the
perpendicular distance from the outer layer of spheres to the reflector
to be 5 cm in the X, Y, and Z directions. The geometry input for this
system is given below.</p>

<p>In the KENO V.a input, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary defines the origin of the
<strong>REFLECTOR</strong> to be at the center of the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The 6*3.0 in the
<strong>REFLECTOR</strong> description repeats the 3.0 six times. The <strong>REFLECTOR</strong>
record is used to generate ten <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> regions, each of which is
3.0 cm thick, on all six faces of the <strong>ARRAY</strong>.</p>
<p>In the KENO-VI input, the basic <strong>UNIT</strong> used to construct the <strong>ARRAY</strong>
is defined in <strong>UNIT</strong> 1. The <strong>ARRAY</strong> is positioned in <strong>UNIT</strong> 2
(the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>) using the <strong>ARRAY</strong> card and the <strong>PLACE</strong> option.
The <strong>ARRAY</strong> is then surrounded by ten <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> regions, each
3.0 cm thick, on all sides.</p>
<p>The first bias <strong>ID</strong> is 2, so the last bias <strong>ID</strong> will be 11 if
10 regions are created. The biasing data block is necessary to apply
the desired weighting or biasing function to the reflector. The
biasing material ID is obtained from <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-20"><span class="std std-numref">Table 49</span></a>. IDs, group
structure and incremental thickness for
weighting data available on the KENO  weighting library. If the
biasing data block is omitted from the problem description, the 10
reflector regions will not have a biasing function applied to them,
and the default value of the average weight will be used. This may
cause the problem to execute more slowly, and therefore require the
use of more computer time.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 10. Assume the reflector in Example 9 is present only on both
X faces, both Y faces, and the negative Z face. The reflector is only
15.24 cm thick on these faces. The top of the array (positive Z face) is
unreflected.</p>

<p>In the KENO V.a input, the first <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> description generates
five regions around the <strong>ARRAY</strong>, each region being 3.0 cm thick in the
+X, −X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. This defines a total thickness of 15 cm of reflector
material on the appropriate faces. The second <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> description
generates the last 0.24 cm of material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total
reflector thickness is 15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the
top which has no reflector. Five reflector regions were generated by the
first <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> description, and one was generated by the second
<strong>REFLECTOR</strong> description; so, six biasing regions must be defined in
the biasing data. Thus, the beginning bias <strong>ID</strong> is 2, and the ending
bias ID is 7.</p>
<p>In the KENO-VI input, the first <strong>CUBOID</strong> in Unit 2 represents the
boundary for the <strong>ARRAY</strong>. The next four <strong>CUBOID</strong>s represent the
first four regions around the <strong>ARRAY</strong>, each region being 3.0 cm thick
in the +X, X, +Y, −Y, and −Z directions, and of zero thickness in the
+Z direction. A total thickness of 12 cm of reflector material is on the
appropriate faces. The last <strong>CUBOID</strong> represents the last 3.24 cm of
material 2 on those faces. Thus, the total reflector thickness is
15.24 cm on each face of the array, except the top which has no
reflector. The beginning bias ID is 2, and the ending bias ID is 6. The
last region could either be larger or smaller than the recommended
thickness to complete the reflector.</p>
<p>The biasing material <strong>ID</strong> and thickness per region are obtained from
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-20"><span class="std std-numref">Table 49</span></a>. The thickness per region should be very nearly the
thickness per region from the table to avoid over biasing in the
reflector. Partial increments at the outer region of a reflector are
exempt from this recommendation. If a biasing function is not to be
applied to a region generated by the <strong>REFLECTOR</strong> record, the thickness
per region can be any desired thickness and the biasing data block is
omitted.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 11. Assume the array of Example 7 has the central unit of the
array replaced by a cylinder of material 4, 5 cm in radius and 10 cm
tall. Assume a 20 cm thick spherical reflector of material 3 (concrete)
is positioned so its inner radius is 65 cm from the center of the array.
The minimum inner radius of a spherical reflector for this array is
62.25 cm (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sqrt{55^{2} + 25^{2} + 15^{2} }\)</span>). If the inner radius is smaller than this, the problem
cannot be described using KENO V.a geometry.</p>

<p><strong>UNIT</strong> 1 describes the <strong>SPHERE</strong> and spacing used in the <strong>ARRAY</strong>.
<strong>UNIT</strong> 2 defines the <strong>CYLINDER</strong> located at the center of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong>. In KENO V.a, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> record defines the origin of the
reflector to be at the center of the <strong>ARRAY</strong>, while in KENO-VI it
defines the origin of the <strong>ARRAY</strong> to be at the center of the <strong>GLOBAL
UNIT</strong>. The first <strong>SPHERE</strong> in the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> defines the inner
radius of the reflector. The next four <strong>SPHERE</strong> and four <strong>MEDIA</strong>
records of the KENO-VI input and the <strong>REPLICATE</strong> record of the KENO
V.a input will generate four spherical regions of material 3, each
5.0 cm thick. The data for the <strong>BIAS</strong> block is generated in a similar
manner to previous examples, except that concrete (ID=301) is used. The
recommended reflector thickness is 5 cm; this thickness is incorporated
explicitly in the KENO-VI model and with 4 repetitions of the 5 cm thick
reflector via <strong>REPLICATE</strong> in the KENO V.a model. The first 10 entries
following the word <strong>LOOP</strong> fills the 11 × 5 × 3 <strong>ARRAY</strong> with
<strong>UNIT</strong>s 1. The next 10 entries position <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 at the center of
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> (X = 6, Y = 3, and Z = 2), replacing the <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 that
had been placed there by the first 10 entries.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 12. Assume a data profile such as fission densities is desired
in a cylinder at 0.5 cm intervals in the radial direction and 1.5 cm
intervals axially. The cylinder is composed of material 1 and has a
radius of 5 cm and a height of 15 cm. The <strong>REPLICATE</strong> or <strong>REFLECTOR</strong>
description can be used to generate these regions in KENO V.a. A biasing
data block is not entered because default biasing is desired throughout
the cylinder.</p>

<span id="id35"></span><h4>Use of holes in the geometry<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-holes-in-the-geometry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#id34"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry</span></a> tells how each KENO V.a geometry region in a <strong>UNIT</strong>
must completely enclose all previously described regions in that
<strong>UNIT</strong> and how KENO-VI geometry allows regions in a <strong>UNIT</strong> to
intersect, thus eliminating the need for <strong>HOLE</strong>s. <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be
used to circumvent the complete enclosure restriction in KENO V.a to
some degree. In KENO-VI, they can be useful in simplifying the input of
a problem and decreasing the total CPU time needed for a problem.
A <strong>HOLE</strong> is a means of placing an entire <strong>UNIT</strong> within a geometry
region. A separate <strong>HOLE</strong> description is required for every location
in a geometry region where a <strong>UNIT</strong> is to be placed. The information
contained in a <strong>HOLE</strong> description is (1) the keyword <strong>HOLE</strong>, (2) the
<strong>UNIT</strong> number of the <strong>UNIT</strong> to be placed, and (3) any modification
data needed to correctly position and rotate (in KENO-VI) the specified
<strong>UNIT</strong> within the containing <strong>UNIT</strong>. In KENO V.a, a <strong>HOLE</strong> is
placed inside the geometry region that precedes it. This excludes
<strong>HOLE</strong>s … (i.e., if a <strong>CUBE</strong> geometry region is followed by four
<strong>HOLE</strong> descriptions, all four <strong>HOLE</strong>s are located within the
<strong>CUBE</strong>). In KENO V.a, <strong>HOLE</strong>s are subject to the restriction that
they cannot intersect any other geometry region. <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be
nested to any depth (see <a class="reference internal" href="#id36"><span class="std std-ref">Nesting holes</span></a>). It is not advisable to use
<strong>HOLE</strong>s tangent to other <strong>HOLE</strong>s or geometry, because round-off
error may cause them to overlap. It is not uncommon for a problem that
runs on one type of computer to fail on another type using the same
data. Therefore, it is recommended that tangency and boundaries shared
with <strong>HOLE</strong>s be avoided. This may be accomplished by separating the
otherwise collocated or tangent surfaces by a very small (i.e.,
10<sup>-6</sup> cm) distance.</p>
<p>In KENO V.a, tracking in regions that contain holes is less efficient
than tracking in regions that do not contain holes. Therefore, holes
should be used only when the system cannot be easily described by
conventional methods. One example of the use of holes is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 73</span></a>, representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus.</p>
<p>In KENO-VI, tracking in regions that contain <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be more
efficient than tracking in regions that do not contain <strong>HOLE</strong>s
because every region boundary in a <strong>UNIT</strong> must be checked for a
crossing whenever a crossing is possible. Putting small but complex
geometries in a hole will lessen the number of boundaries that need to
be checked for possible crossings. However, the indiscriminate use of
holes is not advised since the particle must change coordinate systems
every time a hole is entered or exited. Therefore, holes should be used

<p>EXAMPLE 15. One example of a unit that requires holes in KENO V.a is
better described not using holes in KENO-VI as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 73</span></a>,
representing nine close-packed rods in an annulus. The large rods are
1.4 cm in radius and composed of mixture 3. The small rods are 0.6 cm
in radius and composed of mixture 1. The inside radius of the annulus
is 3.6 cm, and the outside radius is 3.8 cm. The annulus is made of
mixture 2. The rods and annulus are both 30 cm long. The annulus is
centered in a cuboid having an 8 cm<sup>2</sup> cross section and a
length of 32 cm. The black and gray areas in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 73</span></a> are void.</p>

<p>The first <strong>HOLE</strong> description in the KENO V.a input represents the
bottom large rod. It takes <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 and places its <strong>ORIGIN</strong> at
(0.0,−2.0,0.0) relative to the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> of <strong>UNIT</strong> 3. The second
<strong>HOLE</strong> description represents the small rod to the right of the large
rod just discussed. It places the origin of <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 at (2.0,−2.0,0.0)
in <strong>UNIT</strong> 3. The third <strong>HOLE</strong> description represents the large rod
to the right. It places the origin of <strong>UNIT</strong> 2 at (2.0,0.0,0.0) in
<strong>UNIT</strong> 3. This procedure is repeated in a counterclockwise direction
until all eight rods have been placed within the region that defines the
inner surface of the annulus. The <strong>CYLINDER</strong> that defines the outer
surface of the annulus is described after all the <strong>HOLE</strong>s for the
previous region have been placed. Then the outer <strong>CUBOID</strong> is
described. This example illustrates that a <strong>UNIT</strong> that is to be placed
using a <strong>HOLE</strong> description need not have a <strong>CUBE</strong> or <strong>CUBOID</strong> as
its last region. Note that including the central rod directly in
<strong>UNIT</strong> 3 reduces the CPU time required for transport compared to the
case of all 9 rods being inserted as <strong>HOLE</strong>s. It is also important
that the 9 <strong>HOLE</strong>s are inserted <em>after</em> the void cylinder into which
they are inserted. Entering the <strong>HOLE</strong>s in any other position in the
input would generated region intersection errors. The order of the HOLE
records in any given region is not important, as they can be
interchanged with each other randomly. However, they must always appear
immediately after the region in which they are placed.</p>
<p>The KENO-VI input does not need to use <strong>HOLE</strong>s. The first
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> description in this case represents the middle small rod.
The next four <strong>CYLINDER</strong> records describe the four remaining small
rods surrounding the middle rod. The <strong>ORIGIN</strong> attribute is used to
shift the origin of each <strong>CYLINDER</strong> to the appropriate location. The
following four <strong>CYLINDER</strong> records represent the four large rods.
Again, the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> attribute is used to shift the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> of each
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> to the appropriate location. Only the nonzero dimensions
need to be entered in the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> data. The tenth <strong>CYLINDER</strong> record
is the void in the annulus that contains the rods. The last <strong>CYLINDER</strong>
record defines the outer surface of the annulus. Finally, the <strong>CUBOID</strong>
record describes the surrounding <strong>UNIT</strong> boundary.</p>
<p>In KENO-VI, holes may not extend across any array outer boundary, may
not intersect with other holes, and may not cross the host UNIT outer
boundary. Thus a hole may be placed so that it crosses several regions
within an array. The hole description replaces the unit description
within the hole domain. Since the holes are placed using the host UNIT
coordinate system, the location of the hole record in the unit
definition is not relevant.</p>
<p>An array of the arrangement shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-19"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 73</span></a> can be easily described
by altering the array description data. For example, a 5 × 3 × 2 array
of these shapes with a center-to-center spacing of 8 cm in X and Y and
32 cm in Z can be achieved by using the following array data:</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 16. There is no predetermined preferred method to create a
geometry mockup for a given physical system. The user should determine
the most convenient order. To describe the configuration shown in Fig.
8.1.20 using nested <strong>HOLE</strong>s, it is likely most convenient to start
the geometry mockup at the deepest nesting level, as shown in
Fig. 8.1.22. The small <strong>CYLINDER</strong>s are composed of mixture 1, and
they are each 0.1 cm in radius and 30 cm long. There are five small
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>s used in Fig. 8.1.22. Their centers are located at
(0,0,0) for the central one, at (0,−0.4,0) for the bottom one, at
(0.4,0,0) for the right one, at (0,0.4,0) for the top one, and at
(−0.4,0,0) for the left one. The rectangular parallelepipeds
(<strong>CUBOID</strong>s) are composed of mixture 2. Each one is 30 cm long and
0.1 cm by 0.2 cm in cross section. The large <strong>CYLINDER</strong> containing the
configuration is composed of mixture 3, is 30 cm long and has a radius
of 0.5 cm.</p>
<p>A possible geometry mockup for this system is described as follows in
KENO V.a:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>define a small cylinder to be <strong>UNIT</strong> 1,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(2) define a small <strong>CUBOID</strong> with its length in the X direction to
be <strong>UNIT</strong> 2,</p>
<p>(3) define a small <strong>CUBOID</strong> with its length in the Y direction to
be <strong>UNIT</strong> 3,</p>
<p>(4) define <strong>UNIT</strong> 4 to be the large cylinder and place the
<strong>CYLINDER</strong>s and <strong>CUBOID</strong>s in it using <strong>HOLE</strong>s.</p>

<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-21"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 75</span></a>, the large plain cylinders are composed of mixture 1 and
are 0.5 cm in radius and 30 cm long. The cylindrical component of
<strong>UNIT</strong> 4 for KENO V.a or <strong>UNIT</strong> 1 for KENO-VI is the same size: an
outer radius of 0.5 cm and a length of 30 cm. The small cylinders
located in the interstices between the large cylinders are composed of
mixture 2, are 0.2 cm in radius, and are 30 cm long. The annulus is
composed of mixture 4, has a 1.3 cm inside radius and a 1.4 cm outer
radius. The volume between the inner cylinders is void. The large
cylinders each have a radius of 0.5 cm and are tangent. Therefore, their
origins are offset from the origin of the <strong>UNIT</strong> by 0.707107. This is
from X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> = 1.0, where X and Y are equal.</p>
<p>For KENO V.a, define <strong>UNIT</strong> 5 to be the large plain cylinder,
<strong>UNIT</strong> 6 to be the small cylinder, and <strong>UNIT</strong> 7 as the annulus that
contains the cylinders. Its origin is at its center. The geometry mockup

<p>EXAMPLE 17. <a class="reference internal" href="#id34"><span class="std std-ref">Geometry</span></a> demonstrates how <strong>UNIT</strong>s are composed of
geometry regions and how these <strong>UNIT</strong>s can be stacked in an
<strong>ARRAY</strong>. This same procedure can be extended to create multiple
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s. Furthermore, <strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be used as building blocks
within other <strong>ARRAY</strong>s.</p>
<p>Consider Sample Problem 19 from Appendix C. This problem is a critical
experiment consisting of a composite array <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="#thomas-critical-1973" id="id38">[Tho73]</a><a class="bibtex reference internal" href="#thomas-critical-1964" id="id39">[Tho64]</a> of four
highly enriched uranium metal cylinders and four cylindrical Plexiglas
containers filled with uranyl nitrate solution. A photograph of the
experiment is given in <code class="xref std std-numref docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fig9-1c-3</span></code>. The coordinate system is defined to
be Z up the page, Y across the page, and X out of the page.</p>
<p>The Plexiglas containers have an inside radius of 9.525 cm and an
outside radius of 10.16 cm. The inside height is 17.78 cm, and the
outside height is 19.05 cm. Four of these containers are stacked with a
center-to-center spacing of 21.75 cm in the Y direction and 20.48 cm in
the Z direction (vertical). This arrangement of four Plexiglas
containers can be described as follows: mixture 2 is the uranyl nitrate
and mixture 3 is Plexiglas, so the Plexiglas container with its
appropriate spacing <strong>CUBOID</strong> can be described as <strong>UNIT</strong> 1. This
considers the <strong>ARRAY</strong> to be bare and suspended with no supports.</p>

<p>The four metal cylinders, comprised of mixture 1, each have a radius of
5.748 cm and are 10.765 cm tall. They have a center-to-center spacing of
13.18 cm in the Y direction and 12.45 cm in the Z direction (vertical).
Thus, one of the metal cylinders with its appropriate spacing <strong>CUBOID</strong>
can be described as <strong>UNIT</strong> 2. This <strong>ARRAY</strong> is also considered to be
bare and unsupported.</p>

<p>Now two <strong>ARRAY</strong>s have been described. The overall dimensions of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> of Plexiglas containers are 21.75 cm in X, 43.5 cm in Y, and
40.96 cm in Z. The overall dimensions of the <strong>ARRAY</strong> of metal
cylinders are 13.18 cm in X, 26.36 cm in Y, and 24.9 cm in Z.</p>
<p>In order to describe the composite <strong>ARRAY</strong>, these two <strong>ARRAY</strong>s
must be positioned within <strong>UNIT</strong>s and stacked together into one
<strong>ARRAY</strong>. In order for them to be stacked into one <strong>ARRAY</strong>, the
adjacent faces must match. This is accomplished by defining a <strong>UNIT</strong> 3
which contains <strong>ARRAY</strong> 1, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> of Plexiglas solution
containers. The overall dimensions of this <strong>UNIT</strong> are 21.75 cm in X,
43.5 cm in Y, and 40.96 cm in Z. These dimensions are calculated by the
code and need not be specified. <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 is defined as follows:</p>

<p>The <strong>ARRAY</strong> of metal cylinders will be defined to be <strong>UNIT</strong> 4.
However, this <strong>ARRAY</strong> is 17.14 cm smaller in the Y and 16.06 cm
smaller in the Z dimensions than the <strong>ARRAY</strong> of Plexiglas <strong>UNIT</strong>s.
Therefore, a void region must be placed around the <strong>ARRAY</strong> in those
directions so <strong>UNIT</strong> 4 and <strong>UNIT</strong> 3 will be the same size in Y and
Z.</p>

<strong>STORAGE ARRAY</strong></p><p>EXAMPLE 18. Consider a storage array of highly enriched uranium buttons,
each 1 in. tall and 4 in. in diameter. These buttons are stored on
stainless steel shelves with a center-to-center spacing of 60.96 cm
(2 ft) between them in the Y direction, and only one button on each
shelf in the X direction. The shelves are 0.635 cm
(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in.) thick (Z dimension), 45.72 cm (18 in.) wide (X
dimension), 609.6 cm (20 ft) long (Y dimension), and are 45.72 cm
(18 in.) from the top of a shelf to the bottom of the shelf above it.
Each rack of storage shelves is four shelves high, with the first shelf
being 15.24 cm (6 in.) above the floor. The storage room is 586.56 cm
(19.5 ft) in the X direction by 1293.44 cm (43 ft) in the Y direction
with 365.76 cm (12 ft. ) ceilings in the Z direction. The walls,
ceiling, and floor are composed of concrete, 30.48 cm (1 ft) thick. All
the aisles between the storage racks are 91.44 cm (3 ft) wide. The racks
are arranged with their length in the Y direction and an aisle between
them. The arrays of racks are arranged with two in the Y direction and
five in the X direction. Mixture 1 is the uranium metal, mixture 2 is
the stainless steel, and mixture 3 is the concrete.</p>
<p>The metal button and its center-to-center spacing are described first.
The void vertical spacing has arbitrarily been chosen to extend from the
bottom of the button to the next shelf above the button. The shelf of
stainless steel is described under the button.</p>
