<p>KENO is a three-dimensional (3D) Monte Carlo criticality transport
program developed and maintained for use as part of the SCALE Code
System. It can be used as part of a sequence or as a standalone program.
There are two versions of the code currently supported in SCALE.
KENO V.a is the older of the two. KENO-VI contains all current KENO V.a
features plus a more flexible geometry package known as the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package. The geometry package in KENO-VI is capable
of modeling any volume that can be constructed using quadratic
equations. In addition, such features as geometry intersections, body
rotations, hexagonal and dodecahedral arrays, and array boundaries have
been included to make the code more flexible.</p>
<p>The simpler geometry features supported by KENO V.a allow for
significantly shorter execution times than KENO-VI, while the additional
geometry features supported in KENO-VI make the code appropriate for
cases where geometry modeling is not possible with KENO V.a. In
particular, KENO-VI allows intersections, body truncations with planes,
and a much wider variety of geometrical bodies. KENO-VI also has the
ability to rotate bodies so that volumes no longer must be positioned
parallel to a major axis. Hexagonal arrays are available in KENO-VI and
dohecahedral arrays enable the code to model pebble bed reactors and
other systems composed of close packed spheres. The use of array
boundaries makes it possible to fill a non-cuboidal volume with an
array, specifying the boundary where a particle leaves and enters the
array.</p>
<p>Except for geometry capabilities, the two versions of KENO share most of
the computational capabilities and the input flexibility specific to
most SCALE modules. They can both operate in multigroup or continuous
energy mode, run as standalone codes, or integrated in computational
sequences such as CSAS, TSUNAMI-3D, or TRITON. Both versions of the code
are continually updated and are written in FORTRAN 90.</p>
<p>Computational capabilities shared by the two versions of KENO include
the determination of k‑effective, neutron lifetime, generation time,
energy-dependent leakages, energy- and region-dependent absorptions,
fissions, the system mean-free-path, the region-dependent
mean-free-path, average neutron energy, flux densities, fission
densities, reaction rate tallies, mesh tallies, source convergence
diagnostics, problem-dependent continuous energy temperature treatments,
parallel calculations, restart capabilities, and many more.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>
<p>Many individuals have contributed significantly to the development of
KENO. Special recognition is given to G. E. Whitesides, former Director
of the Computing Applications Division, who was responsible for the
concept and development of the original KENO code. He has also
contributed significantly to some of the techniques used in both KENO
versions. The late J. T. Thomas offered many ideas that have been
implemented in the code. R. M. Westfall, retired from ORNL, provided
early consultation, encouragement, and benchmarks for validating the
code. The special abilities of J. R. Knight, retired from ORNL,
contributed substantially to debugging early versions of the code. S. W.
D. Hart was instrumental in implementing continuous energy temperature
treatments. W. J. Marshall has provided substantial validation and
quality assurance reviews. Appreciation is expressed to C. V. Parks and
S. M. Bowman for their support of KENO and the KENO3D visualization
tool. The late P. B. Fox provided many of the figures in this document.
D. Ilas, B. J. Marshall, and D. E. Mueller consolidated the previous
KENO V.a and KENO-VI manuals into this present form. The efforts of
L. F. Norris (retired), W. C. Carter (retired), S. J. Poarch, D. J.
Weaver (retired), S. Y. Walker and R. B. Raney in preparing this

<h2>Introduction to KENO<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-keno" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KENO, a functional module in the SCALE system, is a Monte Carlo
criticality program used to calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_{eff}\)</span>, fluxes, reaction rates,
and other data for three-dimensional (3-D) systems. Special features
include multigroup or continuous energy mode, simplified data input, the
ability to specify origins for spherical and cylindrical geometry
regions, a P<sub>n</sub> scattering treatment, and restart capability.</p>
<p>The KENO data input features flexibility in the order of input. The only
restrictions are that the sequence identifier, title, and cross section
library must be entered first. A large portion of the data has been
assigned default values found to be adequate for many
problems. This feature enables the user to run a problem with a minimum
of input data.</p>
<p>In addition to the features listed above, KENO-VI uses the SCALE
Generalized Geometry Package (SGGP), which contains a much larger set of
geometrical bodies, including cuboids, cylinders, spheres, cones,
dodecahedrons, elliptical cylinders, ellipsoids, hoppers,
parallelepipeds, planes, rhomboids, and wedges. The code’s flexibility
is increased by allowing: intersecting geometry regions; hexagonal,
dodecahedral, and cuboidal arrays; bodies and holes rotated to any angle
and translated to any position; and a specified array boundary that
contains only that portion of the array located inside the boundary.
Users should be aware that the added geometry features in KENO‑VI can
result in significantly longer run times than KENO V.a. A KENO-VI
problem that can be modeled in KENO V.a will typically run about four
times as long with KENO-VI as it does with KENO V.a. Therefore KENO-VI
is not a replacement for KENO V.a, but rather an additional version for
more complex geometries that could not be modeled previously.</p>
<p>Blocks of input data are entered in the form</p>
<p><strong>READ XXXX</strong> <em>input_data</em> <strong>END XXXX,</strong></p>
<p>where <strong>XXXX</strong> is the keyword for the type of data being entered. The
types of data entered include parameters, geometry region data, array
definition data, biasing or weighting data, albedo boundary conditions,
starting distribution information, the cross section mixing table, extra
one-dimensional (1-D) (reaction rate) cross section IDs for special
applications, energy group boundaries for tallying in the continuous
energy mode, a mesh grid for collecting flux moments, and printer plot
information.</p>
<p>A block of data can be omitted unless it is needed or desired for the
problem. Within the blocks of data, most of the input is activated by
using keywords to override default values.</p>
<p>The treatment of the energy variable can be either multigroup or
continuous. Changing the calculation mode from multigroup to continuous
energy or vice versa is established by simply changing the cross section
library used. All available calculated entities in the multigroup mode
can also be calculated in the continuous energy mode. If the calculated
entity is energy or group dependent, it is automatically tallied into
the appropriate group structure in the continuous energy mode.</p>
<p>The KENO V.a geometry input consists of spheres, hemispheres, cylinders,
hemicylinders, and cuboids. Although the origin of the cylinders,
hemicylinders, spheres, and hemispheres is zero by default, they may be
specified to any value that will allow the geometry to fit in the
problem. This feature allows the use of nonconcentric cylindrical and
spherical shapes and provides a great deal of freedom in positioning
them. Another feature that expands the generality of the code is the
ability to place the cut surface of the hemicylinders and hemispheres at
any distance between the radius and the origin.</p>
<p>An additional convenience is the availability of an alternative method
for specifying the array definition unit-location data. This method uses
FIDO-like options for filling the array.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, KENO-VI uses the SGGP, which contains a much more
flexible geometry package than the one in KENO V.a. In KENO-VI, geometry
regions are constructed and processed as sets of quadratic equations. A
set of geometric shapes (including all of those used in KENO V.a plus
others) is available in KENO-VI, as well as the ability to build more
complex geometric shapes using sets of quadratic equations. Unlike
KENO V.a, KENO-VI allows intersections between geometry regions within a
unit, and it provides the ability to specify an array boundary that
intersects the array.</p>
<p>The most flexible KENO V.a geometry features are the
“<strong>ARRAY</strong>-of-<strong>ARRAY</strong>s” and “<strong>HOLE</strong>s” capabilities. The
<strong>ARRAY</strong>-of-<strong>ARRAY</strong>s option allows the construction of <strong>ARRAY</strong>s
from other <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. The depth of nesting is limited only by
computer space restrictions. This option greatly simplifies the setup
for <strong>ARRAY</strong>s involving different <strong>UNIT</strong>s at different spacings.
The <strong>HOLE</strong> option allows a <strong>UNIT</strong> or an <strong>ARRAY</strong> to be placed at
any desired location within a geometry region. The emplaced <strong>UNIT</strong> or
<strong>ARRAY</strong> cannot intersect any geometry region and must be wholly
contained within a region. As many <strong>HOLE</strong>s as will snugly fit
without intersecting can be placed in a region. This option is
especially useful for describing shipping casks and reflectors that have
gaps or other geometrical features. Any number of <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be
described in a problem, and <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be nested to any depth.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the KENO V.a and KENO-VI geometry input
is the methodology used to represent the geometry/material regions in a
unit. KENO-VI uses two geometry records (cards) to describe a region.
The first record, called the GEOMETRY record, contains the geometry
(<strong>shape</strong>) keyword, region boundary definitions, and any geometry
modification data. Using geometry modification data, regions can be
rotated and translated to any angle and position within a unit. The
second record, the <strong>CONTENT</strong> record, contains the <strong>MEDIA</strong> keyword;
the material, <strong>HOLE</strong>, or <strong>ARRAY</strong> ID number; the bias ID number; and
the region definition vector. KENO-VI requires that a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong> be
specified in all problems, including single unit problems.</p>
<p>In addition to the <em>cuboidal</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s available in KENO V.a,
<em>hexagonal</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <em>dodecahedral</em> <strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be directly
constructed in KENO-VI. Also, the ability to specify an <strong>ARRAY</strong>
boundary that intersects the <strong>ARRAY</strong> makes it possible to construct a
lattice in a cylinder using one <strong>ARRAY</strong> in KENO-VI instead of multiple
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s and <strong>HOLE</strong>s as would be required in KENO V.a.</p>
<p>Anisotropic scattering is treated by using discrete scattering angles.
The angles and associated probabilities are generated in a manner that
preserves the moments of the angular scattering distribution for the
selected group-to-group transfer. These moments can be derived from the
coefficients of a P<sub>n</sub> Legendre polynomial expansion. All moments
through the 2n − 1 moment are preserved for n discrete scattering
angles. A one-to-one correspondence exists such that n Legendre
coefficients yield n moments. The cases of zero and one scattering angle
are treated in a special manner. Even when the user specifies multiple
scattering angles, KENO can recognize that the distribution is
isotropic, and therefore KENO selects from a continuous isotropic
distribution. If the user specifies one scattering angle, the code
selects the scattering angle from a linear function if it is positive
between -1 and +1, and otherwise it performs semicontinuous scattering
by picking scattering angle cosines uniformly over some range between –1
and +1. The probability is zero over the rest of the range.</p>
<p>The KENO restart option is easy to activate. Certain changes can be made
when a problem is restarted, including using a different random sequence
or turning off certain print options such as fluxes or the fissions and
absorptions by region.</p>
<p>KENO can also compute angular fluxes and flux moments in multigroup
calculations, which are required to compute scattering terms for
generation of sensitivity coefficients with the SAMS module or the
TSUNAMI-3D control module. Fluxes can also be accumulated in a Cartesian
mesh that is superimposed over the user-defined geometry in an automated
manner.</p>
<p>KENO can perform Monte Carlo transport calculations concurrently on a
number of computational nodes. By introducing a simple master-slave
approach via MPI, KENO runs different random walks concurrently on the
replicated geometry within the same generation. Fission source and other
tallied quantities are gathered at the end of each generation by the
master process and are then processed either for final edits or
subsequent generations. Code parallel performance is strongly dependent
on the size of the problem simulated and the size of the tallied
quantities.</p>

<h2>KENO Data Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#keno-data-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>KENO may be run stand alone or as part of a SCALE criticality safety or
sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sequence. If KENO is run stand
alone in the multigroup mode, cross section data can be used from an
AMPX <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id1">[2]_</span></a> working format library or from a Monte Carlo format cross
section library. If KENO uses an AMPX working format library, a mixing
table data block must be entered. If a Monte Carlo format library is
used, a mixing table data block is not entered, and the mixtures
specified in the KENO geometry description must be consistent with the
mixtures created on the Monte Carlo format library file.</p>
<p>If KENO is run stand alone in the continuous energy mode, a mixing table
data block must be provided unless the restart option is used.</p>
<p>If KENO is run as part of a SCALE criticality safety or sensitivity and
uncertainty analysis sequence, the mixtures are defined in the CSAS or
TSUNAMI-3D input, and a mixing table data block cannot be entered in
KENO. Furthermore, the mixture numbers used in the KENO geometry
description must correspond to those defined in the composition data
block of the CSAS or TSUNAMI-3D input. To use a cell-weighted mixture in
KENO, the keyword “<strong>CELLMIX</strong>=,” followed by a unique mixture
number, must be specified in the unit cell data of the CSAS or
TSUNAMI‑3D sequence. Unit cell data are applicable only in the
multigroup mode. The mixture number used in the KENO input is the unique
mixture number immediately following the keyword “<strong>CELLMIX</strong>=.” A
cell‑weighted mixture is available only in SCALE sequences that use
XSDRN to perform a cell-weighting calculation using a multigroup cross
section library. <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-1"><span class="std std-numref">Table 30</span></a> through <a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-14"><span class="std std-numref">Table 43</span></a> summarize the KENO
input data blocks. These input data blocks are discussed in detail in
the following sections.</p>
<p>In order to run KENO parallel (standalone execution), the user must
provide a name with the “%” prefix in the input file (=%kenovi). Control
modules like CSAS, TRITON, and TSUNAMI-3D automatically initiate
parallel KENO execution if the user provides the required arguments
while running this code.</p>

<p>Three data records <strong>must</strong> be entered for every problem: first the
SCALE sequence identifier, then the problem title, and then the <strong>END
DATA</strong> to terminate the problem.</p>
<p>(1) KENO is typically run using one of the SCALE CSAS or TSUNAMI
sequences, but it may also be run stand alone using KENO V.a or KENO-VI.
The sequence identifier is specified using one line similar to:</p>
<p>=kenovi</p>
<p>This line may also include additional runtime directives that are
described throughout the SCALE manual. For example:</p>
<p>=kenova parm=check</p>

<p>The KENO codes in previous SCALE versions allowed for only one

<p>The option to define multiple spatial meshes during a single simulation
has been implemented in the KENO codes to add flexibility to mesh-based
quantity calculations. The new implementation requires that each mesh
definition in the <strong>READ GRID</strong> block should have a unique NUMBER (grid
ID), which is used for mesh assignment. Users can assign any number of
mesh-based quantities by setting the mesh parameters <strong>SCD</strong>, <strong>CDS</strong>,

<p>To support these former and new definition formats, the parameters
<strong>SCD</strong>, <strong>CDS</strong>, <strong>GFX</strong>, <strong>MFX</strong> and <strong>CGD</strong> have been redesigned to
allow either integer or logical entries. Integer entries are required if
multiple mesh-based quantities are requested by the user. In this case,
each integer entry must point to a grid ID specified in any <strong>READ

<span id="id2"></span><h3>Geometry data<a class="headerlink" href="#geometry-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <em>GEOMETRY_ DATA</em> consists of a series of <strong>UNIT</strong> descriptions, one
of which may be the <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>. The <strong>UNIT</strong> is the basic geometry
piece in KENO and often corresponds to a well-defined physical entity
(e.g., a fuel pin). A <strong>UNIT</strong>, therefore, may consist of multiple
<em>material regions</em>. Each <strong>UNIT</strong> has its own, local coordinate system.
The <strong>UNIT</strong>s are assembled to construct the problem’s global geometry
for KENO. The <em>GEOMETRY_ DATA</em> must be entered unless the problem is
being restarted. See <span class="xref std std-ref">8-1-3-6</span> for detailed examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="units">
<h4>UNITS<a class="headerlink" href="#units" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Geometric arrangements in KENO are achieved in a manner similar to using
a child’s building blocks. Each building block is called a <strong>UNIT</strong>. An
<strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice is constructed by stacking these <strong>UNIT</strong>s. Once
an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice has been constructed, it can be placed in a
<strong>UNIT</strong> by using an <strong>ARRAY</strong> specification.</p>
<p>Each <strong>UNIT</strong> in an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or lattice has its own coordinate system.
In KENO V.a, all coordinate systems in all <strong>UNIT</strong>s must have the
same orientation. This restriction is removed in KENO-VI. All geometry
data used in a problem are correlated to the absolute coordinate system
by specifying a <strong>GLOBAL UNIT</strong>. <strong>UNIT</strong>s are constructed of
combinations from several allowed <strong>shape</strong>s or geometric regions.
These regions can be placed anywhere within a <strong>UNIT</strong>. In KENO V.a the
regions are oriented along the coordinate system of the <strong>UNIT</strong> and do
not intersect other regions. This means, for example, that a
<strong>CYLINDER</strong> must have its axis parallel to one of the coordinate axes,
while a rectangular parallelepiped must have its faces perpendicular to
a coordinate axis. The most stringent KENO V.a geometry restriction is
that none of the options allow geometry regions to intersect. In KENO
V.a, each region in a unit must entirely contain each preceding region.
The orientation, intersection, and containment restrictions are
eliminated in KENO-VI. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-1"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 55</span></a> shows some situations that are not
allowed in KENO V.a, but are allowed in KENO-VI.</p>

</div>
<p>For KENO V.a, unless special options are invoked, each geometric region
in a <strong>UNIT</strong> must completely enclose each interior region. Regions may
touch at points of tangency and may share faces. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 56</span></a> for
examples of allowable situations.</p>

</div>
<p>Special options are provided to circumvent the complete enclosure
restriction in KENO V.a or to enhance the basic geometry package in
KENO-VI. These options include <strong>ARRAY</strong> and <strong>HOLE</strong> descriptions. The
<strong>HOLE</strong> option is the simplest of these and allows placing a <strong>UNIT</strong>
anywhere within a region of another <strong>UNIT.</strong> In KENO V.a, <strong>HOLE</strong>s
are not allowed to intersect the region into which they are placed; this
restriction does not apply in KENO-VI (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-3"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 57</span></a>). In both geometry
packages, a <strong>HOLE</strong> cannot intersect the <strong>UNIT</strong> boundary. It is
recommended that the outer boundary of a <strong>UNIT</strong> used as a <strong>HOLE</strong>
should not be tangent to or share a boundary with another <strong>HOLE</strong> or a
region of the <strong>UNIT</strong> containing the <strong>HOLE</strong> because the code may find
that the regions are intersecting due to precision and round-off. Since
a particle must check every region to determine its location within a
<strong>UNIT</strong>, using <strong>HOLE</strong>s to contain complex sections of a problem may
decrease the CPU time needed for the problem in KENO-VI. Inclusion of
<strong>HOLE</strong>s increases run-time in KENO V.a, but in many cases cannot be
avoided. An arbitrary number of <strong>HOLE</strong>s can be placed in a region in
combination with a series of surrounding regions. The only restrictions
on <strong>HOLE</strong>s are (1) when they are placed in a <strong>UNIT,</strong> they must be
entirely contained within the <strong>UNIT</strong>, and (2) they cannot intersect
other <strong>HOLE</strong>s or nested <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. <strong>HOLE</strong>s in KENO V.a cannot
intersect an <strong>ARRAY</strong>; in KENO-VI, the <strong>HOLE</strong> cannot intersect the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary.</p>

<p>Lattices or arrays are created by stacking <strong>UNIT</strong>s. In KENO V.a,
only rectangular parallelepipeds can be organized in an <strong>ARRAY</strong>.
<strong>HEXPRISM</strong>s and <strong>DODECAHEDRON</strong>s are allowed in KENO-VI to
construct triangular pitched or closed-packed dodecahedral <strong>ARRAY</strong>s,
respectively. The adjacent faces of adjacent <strong>UNIT</strong>s stacked in this
manner must match exactly. See <span class="xref std std-ref">8-1-3-6-4</span> for additional

<p>The <strong>ARRAY</strong> option is provided to allow for placing an <strong>ARRAY</strong> or
lattice within a <strong>UNIT</strong>. In KENO-VI, an <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed in a
<strong>UNIT</strong> by inserting it directly into a geometry/material region as a
content record. In KENO V.a, the <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed directly in the
unit like a <strong>CUBOID</strong>: it must be the first region in the <strong>UNIT</strong>, or
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> elements must intersect with the smaller region.
Subsequent regions in the <strong>UNIT</strong> containing the <strong>ARRAY</strong> must contain
it entirely. In KENO-VI, the reverse is true: the region boundary
containing the <strong>ARRAY</strong> must coincide with or be contained within the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary. Therefore, in KENO-VI the region boundary becomes
the <strong>ARRAY</strong> boundary, with the problem ignoring any part of the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> outside the boundary. A particle enters or leaves the
<strong>ARRAY</strong> when the region boundary is crossed. In KENO V.a, only one
<strong>ARRAY</strong> can be placed directly in a UNIT. However, multiple
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be placed within a <strong>UNIT</strong> by using <strong>HOLE</strong>s. When
an <strong>ARRAY</strong> is placed in a <strong>UNIT</strong> via a <strong>HOLE</strong>, the <strong>UNIT</strong> that
contains the <strong>ARRAY</strong> (rather than the <strong>ARRAY</strong> itself) is placed in
the <strong>UNIT</strong>. <strong>ARRAY</strong>s of dissimilar <strong>ARRAY</strong>s can be created by
stacking <strong>UNIT</strong>s that contain <strong>ARRAY</strong>s. In KENO-VI, it is
possible to place multiple <strong>ARRAY</strong>s in a <strong>UNIT</strong> by placing them in
separate regions. Also in KENO-VI, using <strong>HOLE</strong>s to insert
<strong>ARRAY</strong>s allows the <strong>ARRAY</strong>s to be rotated when placed. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-6"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 60</span></a> for an example of an <strong>ARRAY</strong> composed of <strong>UNIT</strong>s
containing <strong>HOLE</strong>s and <strong>ARRAY</strong>s.</p>

<p><strong>GLOBAL</strong> is an attribute that specifies that the respective <strong>UNIT</strong>
is the most comprehensive <strong>UNIT</strong> in the KENO problem to be solved, the

<p>For each <strong>UNIT</strong>, the <strong>UNIT</strong>’s <em>DESCRIPTION</em> follows the

brief discussion of these principles, together with a few examples, is
presented at the end of this section following the description of the
basic input used to build the geometry of a <strong>UNIT</strong>. The keywords that
may be used to define a <strong>UNIT</strong> in KENO are as follows:</p>

<h5>Shape<a class="headerlink" href="#shape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p><strong>Shape</strong> is a generic keyword used to describe a basic geometric shape
that may be used in building the geometry of a particular <strong>UNIT</strong>. The
general format varies between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. In KENO V.a, the
<strong>shape</strong> defines a region containing a material, so the user is
required to provide both a material and a <em>bias ID</em>. In KENO-VI the
<strong>shape</strong> is used strictly as a surface, which is later used to define
the mono-material regions (using the <strong>MEDIA</strong> card). The user is
therefore required to enter a label for this surface so that the
<strong>shape</strong> can be referenced later.</p>

<p>KENO-VI:</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong> <em>l</em> <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>d</em><sub>N</sub> [<em>a</em><sub>1</sub> …* [<em>a</em><sub>M</sub> ]…]</p>
<p><strong>shape</strong> is a generic keyword that describes a basic predefined KENO
shape (e.g., <strong>CUBOID</strong>, <strong>CYLINDER</strong>) that is used to build the
geometry of the <strong>UNIT</strong>. The predefined shapes differ between KENO V.a
and KENO-VI. See Appendix A for a description of the KENO V.a basic
shapes and Appendix B for the KENO-VI shapes.</p>
<p><em>m</em> is the mixture number of the material (positive integer) that fills
the particular shape in KENO V.a <strong>UNIT</strong> description. A material number
of zero indicates a void region (i.e., no material is present in the
volume defined by the <strong>shape</strong>).</p>
<p><em>b</em> is the bias identification number (<em>bias ID</em>, a positive integer)
assigned to the particular region defined by the <strong>shape</strong> in the KENO
V.a <strong>UNIT</strong> description.</p>
<p><em>l</em> is the label (positive integer) assigned to the particular <strong>shape</strong>
in the KENO-VI <strong>UNIT</strong> description. This label is used later to define
a certain mono-material region within the <strong>UNIT</strong>.</p>
<p><em>d</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>d</em><sub>N</sub> represent the <em>N</em> dimensions (floating point numbers) that
define the particular <strong>shape</strong> (e.g., radius of a sphere or cylinder).
See Appendixes A and B for the particular value of <em>N</em> and how each
<strong>shape</strong> is described.</p>
<p><em>a</em><sub>1</sub> … <em>a</em><sub>M</sub> are <em>M</em> optional <em>ATTRIBUTES</em> for the <strong>shape</strong>. The
attributes provide additional flexibility in the <strong>shape</strong> description.
The attributes that may be used with either KENO V.a or KENO-VI are
described below (see shape ATTRIBUTES).</p>
<p>shape ATTRIBUTES</p>
<p>The <em>ATTRIBUTES</em> that can be used to enhance the <strong>shape</strong> description
are <strong>CHORD</strong>, <strong>ORIG</strong>[<strong>IN</strong>], <strong>CENTER</strong>, and <strong>ROTATE</strong> (KENO-VI
only).</p>
<p>The CHORD attribute</p>
<p>This attribute has different formats in KENO V.a and KENO-VI. The user
will notice that it is more restrictive in KENO V.a. Only the
<strong>HEMISPHERE and HEMICYLINDER shape</strong>s can be <strong>CHORD</strong>ed in KENO
V.a, but all 3-D shapes may be <strong>CHORD</strong>ed in KENO-VI.</p>
<p>KENO V.a:
<strong>CHORD</strong> <em>ρ</em></p>
<p>KENO-VI:
<strong>CHORD</strong> [<strong>+X</strong>=<em>x+</em>] [-<strong>X</strong>=<em>x-</em>] [<strong>+Y</strong>=<em>y+</em>]
[-<strong>Y</strong>=<em>y-</em>] [<strong>+Z</strong>=<em>z+</em>] [-<strong>Z</strong>=<em>z-</em>]</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span></dt><dd><p>is the distance <em>ρ</em> from the cut surface to the center of the sphere
or the axis of a hemicylinder. See <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-7"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 61</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig8-1-8"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 62</span></a>. Negative
values of <em>ρ</em> indicate that less than half of the <strong>shape</strong> is retained,
while positive values indicate that more than half of the <strong>shape</strong> will
be retained.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>+X=</strong>, -<strong>X=</strong>, <strong>+Y=</strong>, -<strong>Y=</strong>, <strong>+Z=</strong>, -<strong>Z=</strong></dt><dd><p>are subordinate
keywords that define the axis parallel to the chord. The “+” and “-”
signs are used to define the side of the chord which is included in the
volume. A “+” in the keyword indicates that the more positive side of
the chord is included in the volume. A “-” in the keyword indicates that
the more negative side of the chord is included in the volume.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>x+, x-, y+, y-, z+, z-</em></dt><dd><p>are the coordinates of the plane
perpendicular to the chord. For each chord added to a body, the keyword
<strong>CHORD</strong> must be used, followed by one of the subordinate keywords and
its dimension.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In KENO V.a, the CHORD attribute is applicable for only hemispherical
and hemicylindrical shapes, <em>not</em> for SPHERE, XCYLINDER, YCYLINDER,
CYLINDER, ZCYLINDER, CUBE, or CUBOID.</p>

<p>The ORIG[IN] attribute</p>
<p>The format is slightly different between KENO V.a and KENO-VI. Since the
entries in KENO-VI are key worded, the user has more flexibility in
choosing the order of these entries or in using default values. Only
non-zero values must be entered in KENO-VI, but all applicable values,
whether zero or non-zero, must be entered in KENO V.a.</p>
<p>KENO V.a:
<strong>ORIG</strong>[<strong>IN</strong>] <em>a b</em> [<em>c</em>]</p>
<p>KENO-VI:
<strong>ORIGIN</strong> [<strong>X</strong>=<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>] [<strong>Y</strong>=<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>] [<strong>Z</strong>=<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>]</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span></dt><dd><p>is the X coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; the X

<dt><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span></dt><dd><p>is the Z coordinate of the origin of a sphere or hemisphere; it must
be omitted for all cylinders or hemicylinders.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>X=</strong>, <strong>Y=</strong>, <strong>Z=</strong></dt><dd><p>are the subordinate keywords used to define the
new position of the origin of the <strong>shape</strong>. If the a subordinate
keyword appears more than once after the <strong>ORIGIN</strong> keyword, the values
are summed. If the new value is zero, the particular coordinate does not
need to be specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>z</em><sub>0</sub></dt><dd><p>are the values for the new coordinates where the
origin of the <strong>shape</strong> is to be translated.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The CENTER attribute</p>
<p>This attribute establishes the reference center for the flux moment
calculations, which can be useful in TSUNAMI calculations. The syntax
for this attribute is:</p>
<p><strong>CENTER</strong> <em>center_type</em> [<em>u</em>] [<em>x y z</em>]</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><em>center_type</em></dt><dd><p>is the reference center value, as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab8-1-16"><span class="std std-numref">Table 45</span></a>. The default value is <strong>global</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>u</em></dt><dd><p>is the <strong>UNIT</strong> number to be used as a reference center for this
region when the <em>center_type</em> is <strong>unit</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em></dt><dd><p>are the offset from the point specified by the
<em>center_type</em>. The default is 0.0 for all three entries.</p>
</dd>
